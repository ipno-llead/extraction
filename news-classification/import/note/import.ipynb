Bids deemed outside of a certain range typically trigger a more extensive review. DOTD will continue to monitor increases in bid prices related to supply chain and workforce issues. After a review, DOTD may opt to have the project re-bid. Construction projects are prioritized by road/bridge condition, urgency of improvements, type/volume of traffic, crash records, unforeseeable emergencies that caused damage, and several other factors.

Prospective artists are asked to visit the museum&#x27;s exhibit, &quot;State of the Art: Record&quot; and take in the way each artist creates, responds, or reflects on a record or the idea of one. Use these questions as a starting point: What does it mean to record? What constitutes a record? Who creates the record and can a record be changed? Respond to these ideas or create your own record in any form you desire, including poetry, painting, photography and collage. Responses will be compiled into a zine publication to be released before the exhibition closes. Email your entry to the museum&#x27;s communications and marketing specialist, Sarah Amacker, at samacker1@lsu.edu or mail original work to the museum at LSU Museum of Art, 100 Lafayette St., Shaw Center for the Arts, 5th floor, Baton Rouge, LA 70801.

Fr. Buddy Breaux and Rev. David Denton will officiate. Gene is survived by his wife Junelle G. Jefferies of Loreauville; children Deborah Schwing (Edmond “Beaver”) of New Iberia, Marilyn Bourgeois (David) of New Iberia, Jan DuBois (David) of Kingsland, Georgia and Joe Jefferies (Gretchen) of Friendswood, Texas; two bonus children, Charlotte S. Chaplin (David) of Baton Rouge and Susan Hunsaker (John) of Alexandria; brother Dan Jefferies (Nancy) of Phoenix, Arizona; grandchildren Aaron Schwing, Caroline Schwing Courtois (Joshua), Nicholas Bourgeois (Camille), Blake Bourgeois (Betsy), Garett Bourgeois, Kali Weisz (Derek), Kelsey Kelley (Joel), Parker DuBois (Randi Jo), Spencer Jefferies, Mitchell Jefferies and Drew Jefferies; two bonus grandchildren, Daniel Hunsaker and Luke Hunsaker; and 14 great-grandchildren. Gene was preceded in death by his parents J.B. and Avrice Jefferies; his first wife, LaVonna Manning Jefferies; brother Boyd Jefferies; sister Pauline Wood; and grandson Austin J. Schwing. Gene managed several cattle ranches before completing his undergraduate degree in Animal Science from Arizona State University and his master’s degree in Agricultural Economics from University of Arizona. He began his career in Brazil and later in Venezuela working in agricultural research and development for the U.S. Peace Corps, U.S. Agency for International Development and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. Gene moved to New Iberia in 1977, where he was employed by McIlhenny Company as Director of Agricultural Operations, a position he held for 22 years before retiring in 1999. While at McIlhenny, Paul Bosland, Director of the Chili Pepper Institute wrote, “Gene’s travels and adventures have made him a great leader with worldly experience, offering new insights and has been instrumental in the globalization of peppers.” Gene was a member of the New Iberia Kiwanis Club, serving as a director, vice-president, president and Division Lt. Governor. He was also a volunteer member of the Louisiana Chapter of the Partners of the Americas where he served in Haiti and El Salvador. In 2009, he was appointed as Loreauville’s representative to the Port of Iberia as a Port Commissioner. Additionally, Gene was involved with New Iberia’s Ancient Order of Creole Gourmets, Newcomers’ Club, ULL Life Writing classes and achieved Life Master status as a bridge player. Gene loved nothing more than sitting on the back porch with a glass of wine, enjoying nature and visiting with family and friends. He was a great story teller and a man of integrity who was loved and respected by all who knew him. The family would like to express our deep appreciation and gratitude to those who helped in so many ways during Gene’s last years of life. We also want to thank Dr. Jude Theriot, Palliative Care and Hospice of Acadiana for their compassionate care and guidance.

district will choose whether to add a half-cent sales tax to purchases that will pay for local school construction projects. The election will be held April 30, with early voting scheduled to begin Saturday. The sales tax is projected to raise about $300,000 annually, according to Livingston Parish School officials. “This funding will make a big difference in the Albany School District’s ability to address facility needs,” said Livingston Parish School Board Member Devin Gregoire, who occupies the District 9 board seat representing the Albany area. Proposed school construction projects include a new track and field facility and elementary cafeteria for the Albany School complex. “All of the dollars earned from this half-cent project will remain in the Albany School District, and those construction projects we are proposing are much needed and have been asked for by local citizens for some time,” Gregoire said. The proposition will only be available to voters living in the Albany School taxing district.',\\n

    'Voters in the Albany School tax district will choose whether to add a half-cent sales tax to purchases that will pay for local school construction projects. The election will be held April 30, with early voting underway. The sales tax is projected to raise about $300,000 annually, according to Livingston Parish School officials. “This funding will make a big difference in the Albany School District’s ability to address facility needs,” said Livingston Parish School Board Member Devin Gregoire, who occupies the District 9 board seat representing the Albany area. Proposed school construction projects include a new track and field facility and elementary cafeteria for the Albany School complex. “All of the dollars earned from this half-cent project will remain in the Albany School District, and those construction projects we are proposing are much needed and have been asked for by local citizens for some time,” Gregoire said. The proposition will only be available to voters living in the Albany School taxing district.',\\n

II. Musical impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber learned that the Queen&#x27;s favourite song is satirical Cole Porter number &#x27;Miss Otis Regrets&#x27; and arranged for the star to perform it for the monarch, 95, at a private event to mark her Diamond Jubilee back in 2012. He told the Daily Mail: &quot;I was involved in organising the entertainment for the Queen&#x27;s last Jubilee and we had a private evening. I got Jessie to come and do the song &#x27;Miss Otis Regrets&#x27;, as that is a favourite; and some Rodgers and Hammerstein numbers which I had been told Her Majesty liked.&quot; The legendary composer went on to explain that Jessie - who recently won an Olivier award for her role as Sally Bowles in the critically acclaimed West End revival of &#x27;Cabaret&#x27; - was unfazed by singing &quot;two feet away&quot; from the Queen and described her performance as &quot;wonderful.&quot; He said: &quot;Jessie was singing about two feet away from the Queen. Any performer would have been intimidated, but not a bit of it. She was wonderful&quot; The 32-year-old actress - who recently won an Olivier award for her role as Sally Bowles in the critically acclaimed West End revival of &#x27;Cabaret&#x27; - was discovered by Lord Webber as an 18-year-old when she auditioned for his BBC talent show &#x27;I&#x27;d Do Anything&#x27; back in 2008, which sought to find an actress to play Nancy in his West End revival of Oliver! Despite being a favourite to win the series, Jessie eventually came runner up to Jodie Prenger on the show and the composer went on to claim that losing out on the role was the &quot;best possible&quot; outcome for the Oscar-nominated star. He said: &quot;I got to know her pretty well after the TV show. I think, in a way, her not winning it was the best possible thing that could have happened.&quot;',\\n

Musical impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber learned that the Queen&#x27;s favourite song is satirical Cole Porter number &#x27;Miss Otis Regrets&#x27; and arranged for the star to perform it for the monarch, 95, at a private event to mark her Diamond Jubilee back in 2012. He told the Daily Mail: &quot;I was involved in organising the entertainment for the Queen&#x27;s last Jubilee and we had a private evening. I got Jessie to come and do the song &#x27;Miss Otis Regrets&#x27;, as that is a favourite; and some Rodgers and Hammerstein numbers which I had been told Her Majesty liked.&quot; The legendary composer went on to explain that Jessie was unfazed by singing &quot;two feet away&quot; from the Queen and described her performance as &quot;wonderful.&quot; He said: &quot;Jessie was singing about two feet away from the Queen. Any performer would have been intimidated, but not a bit of it. She was wonderful&quot; The 32-year-old actress - who recently won an Olivier award for her role as Sally Bowles in the critically acclaimed West End revival of &#x27;Cabaret&#x27; - was discovered by Lord Webber as an 18-year-old when she auditioned for his BBC talent show &#x27;I&#x27;d Do Anything&#x27; back in 2008, which sought to find an actress to play Nancy in his West End revival of Oliver! Despite being a favourite to win the series, Jessie eventually came runner up to Jodie Prenger on the show and the composer went on to claim that losing out on the role was the &quot;best possible&quot; outcome for the Oscar-nominated star. He said: &quot;I got to know her pretty well after the TV show. I think, in a way, her not winning it was the best possible thing that could have happened.&quot;',\\n       ...\\n       'A special sales tax to fund supplemental police patrols in the French Quarter will be reinstated starting in October after expiring at the end of 2020. The tax was approved by voters in an April ballot measure and was supposed to take effect last month, but it was delayed due to a legal dispute over whether hotel room sales could be exempt, as they had been previously.\\xa0 But on Thursday, the New Orleans City Council, acting as the French Quarter Economic Development District, the state-created body responsible for levying the tax, voted to reinstate the tax with the hotel exemption intact.\\xa0 It’s still not clear whether the legal issues surrounding the hotel room cut-out are resolved. The exemption, which was not included in the April ballot language that went before French Quarter voters, appears to fly in the face of a decision made by the State Bond Commission in consultation with the State Attorney General’s Office earlier this year, as well as a legal opinion sent to The Lens in July by Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s office.\\xa0 The chair of the Economic Development District, Councilwoman Kristin Palmer, has yet to fully explain how Thursday’s resolution is consistent with the State Bond Commission guidance. On Thursday, she said she was unaware of the objections from the Cantrell administration. Maintaining the hotel exemption was a major priority for the French Quarter Management District, a state-created board made up of representatives of the hospitality industry, French Quarter residents and city government. The FQMD has been extremely influential in the renewal process for the tax, and was given explicit administrative authority over the funds it will generate through the April ballot measure. In July, as council members were preparing to reinstate the tax, the FQMD asked Palmer to delay the tax by three months due to uncertainty over the legality of the hotel exemption. The request to delay was criticized by one FQMD board member, who said that it was bad for public safety and called the FQMD a “business dominated board.” The result of Thursday’s vote is that businesses will be required to collect the tax beginning in October. But before any of the money is actually spent, the city needs to finalize a cooperative endeavor agreement between Mayor Cantrell, the FQEDD and the FQMD.\\xa0 The hotel exemption Thursday’s meeting didn’t include any public discussion about why hotel room sales were being exempted from the tax. In an interview after the meeting, Palmer defended the exemption, saying that hotel room sales are already subject to a number of special taxes that don’t apply to other businesses.\\xa0 “The hotel rooms pay additional taxes over and beyond what the regular sales tax is,” Palmer said. “So this would be considered like a triple tax.” She also emphasized that the exemption was only for hotel room rentals, and that other sales at hotels, like at hotel bars or restaurants, would still be subject to the tax.\\xa0 But Palmer didn’t have a complete rebuttal to the legal concerns raised by the city and State Bond Commission. Her only explanation was that the exemption was a matter of precedent.\\xa0 “The precedent is established because it’s been that way for the past five years,” she said. “That was always the agreement and always the arrangement.” The French Quarter public safety tax, sometimes referred to as the “quarter for the quarter,” was first approved by French Quarter residents in 2015 and went into effect in 2016. From 2016 until 2020, the funds were exclusively used to pay for additional patrols in the neighborhood by the Louisiana State Police.\\xa0 Hotel room sales were exempt from that tax. The exemption wasn’t explicitly included in the 2015 ballot measure, but was later implemented through a FQEDD resolution at a 2016 meeting. As The Lens previously reported, the legal justification for that decision wasn’t mentioned during that meeting, nor any other FQEDD meeting in 2015 or 2016. The only explanation The Lens was able to find was a footnote in a 2015 BGR report on the ballot initiative.\\xa0 “In correspondence with BGR, the city pointed out that economic development districts, by statute, may levy ‘up to two percent of sales taxes, or up to two percent of hotel occupancy taxes.’ (La. R.S. 33:9038.39.) It indicated that, because the language implies a choice between two options, the sales tax should not apply to hotel occupancy.” As the former tax was about to expire at the end of last year, the FQEDD and Cantrell unsuccessfully attempted to renew the tax through a December 2020 ballot measure.\\xa0 Under a plan from the Cantrell administration, the money would have been split between paying for local police patrols and civilian “grounds patrol” units that could help with quality of life issues. The FQMD campaigned against it, and the ballot measure failed with 595 opposed to 297 in favor.\\xa0 The FQMD wanted a larger oversight role and more money dedicated to police patrols through a program it has managed since 2016 — the French Quarter Task Force. After the December ballot measure was shot down, the FQMD began working directly with the FQEDD to introduce a new ballot measure that would give the FQMD explicit administrative powers over the funds. The original April ballot language crafted by the FQMD and FQEDD also included an explicit exemption for hotel room sales. But before the language was finalized, it needed approval from the State Bond Commission. And in February, commission analyst James Pounders told the city the commission wouldn’t approve the ballot language unless the hotel rental exemption was removed based on legal advice from the Attorney General’s Office. “It does not appear the proposition is able to move forward in its current state,” Pounders said.\\xa0 “Essentially, in order to be exempt from local sales taxes, it must either be (1) an item that is exempt from state sales taxes; or (2) a specific tax exemption granted by the legislature that is applicable to all political subdivisions/taxing authorities.” He said that his office looked at state statute regarding local sales tax exemptions, and that it didn’t appear that hotel rooms had any statutory exemption from sales taxes. “Regardless, we think the FQ EDD must provide the statute that they are relying on when granting the hotel tax exemption,” he said. Lela Folse, director of the State Bond Commission, told The Lens on Thursday that the commission hadn’t revisited the issue since February, and therefore its stance hadn’t changed.The FQEDD ultimately removed the exemption from the April ballot, but the FQMD was still determined to establish the exemption through other means.Cantrell’s office, however, has taken the same position as the Bond Commission. City officials sent The Lens a July opinion from its legal counsel that also said hotel room rentals cannot be exempt from the tax.\\xa0 “The tax cannot provide an exemption for hotels. That being said, if no one litigates the issue, it may go forward unnoticed. In this instance, the State Bond Commission brought the issue to light, and the FQEDD amended the voter proposition to take out the exemption for hotels. The public is on notice that the hotel exemption was an issue, and it would be highly risky for the FQEDD to attempt to exempt hotels.” The opinion explicitly warned that the FQEDD could not pass a resolution to create the exemption, which is exactly what the FQEDD ended up doing on Thursday.\\xa0 CEA Negotiations The Cantrell administration, meanwhile, is in the process of negotiating a cooperative endeavor agreement governing the administration of the tax proceeds, which must be signed by the mayor, the FQEDD and the FQMD before the proceeds of the tax can actually be spent.\\xa0 Though the language in the ballot initiative called for giving control to the FQMD, the administration has consistently opposed handing over the funds to the unelected board.\\xa0 “The core issue here is really around good governance,” Josh Cox, a senior adviser to Cantrell, said during a January FQEDD meeting. “And the principle is simple: When taxpayer money is collected, the people who are administering that money should be directly elected by taxpayers.” (There are several examples of existing property and sales taxes administered by unelected boards. In fact, the Cantrell administration, as part of its 2019 “fair share” infrastructure funding deal with the tourism industry and the state, helped negotiate a new short-term rental tax law that hands over a portion of collections to New Orleans & Company, the city’s tourism marketing agency, which is not only unelected but privately run.) The most recent draft of the French Quarter sales tax CEA, provided by the city, effectively gives the mayor and City Council final authority over how the money is spent.\\xa0 The city can’t spend the money on whatever it wants. It will still need to be primarily used for supplemental police patrols as set out in the ballot language approved by voters. But the city and City Council will have authority over the exact details of the annual budget. The annual budget for the funds, according to the current CEA draft, will be written by the city’s chief administrative officer and approved by the City Council. The FQMD will have the opportunity to recommend changes to the budget before the FQEDD finalizes it, but it doesn’t appear they have any type of veto authority if the FQEDD chooses not to accept those recommendations.\\xa0 The CEA hasn’t been signed yet. On Thursday, along with the vote to levy the tax, the FQEDD voted to give Palmer the authority to negotiate and sign the CEA on its behalf. And on Monday, the FQMD is holding a special meeting to consider approving the agreement.\\xa0 The original agenda for the FQMD’s Monday meeting included a discussion about the issue of French Quarter businesses that have continued to collect the quarter-cent sales tax throughout 2021 even though it expired at the end of 2020. (That item was removed from the agenda on Thursday and will no longer be part of Monday’s meeting.) French Quarter Business Association Executive Director Brittany Mulla McGovern told The Lens this week that the city failed to inform businesses to stop collecting the tax. “To the best of our knowledge, the City of New Orleans never notified businesses within the FQEDD boundaries to cease collection,” McGovern said in an email. “We hope that the City will manage the sales tax more efficiently in the future.”\\xa0 In response, Cantrell spokesman Beau Tidwell told The Lens that “we did in fact alert businesses that the tax expired, in a press release dated June 30th.” The tax had expired six months before that press release was issued.\\xa0 Tidwell did not answer questions about whether there is a standard procedure for notifying businesses about expiring sales taxes and whether that procedure was followed in this case. He also didn’t respond to a question about how much money the city has collected from the expired tax so far this year. This story has been updated to reflect that the French Quarter Management District has removed a discussion about erroneously collected taxes from its upcoming meeting agenda.',\\n       'A special sales tax to fund supplemental police patrols in the French Quarter will be reinstated starting in October after expiring at the end of 2020. The tax was approved by voters in an April ballot measure and was supposed to take effect last month, but it was delayed due to a legal dispute over whether hotel room sales could be exempt, as they had been previously.\\xa0 But on Thursday, the New Orleans City Council, acting as the French Quarter Economic Development District, the state-created body responsible for levying the tax, voted to reinstate the tax with the hotel exemption intact.\\xa0 It’s still not clear whether the legal issues surrounding the hotel room cut-out are resolved. The exemption, which was not included in the April ballot language that went before French Quarter voters, appears to fly in the face of a decision made by the State Bond Commission in consultation with the State Attorney General’s Office earlier this year, as well as a legal opinion sent to The Lens in July by Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s office.\\xa0 The chair of the Economic Development District, Councilwoman Kristin Palmer, has yet to fully explain how Thursday’s resolution is consistent with the State Bond Commission guidance. On Thursday, she said she was unaware of the objections from the Cantrell administration. Maintaining the hotel exemption was a major priority for the French Quarter Management District, a state-created board made up of representatives of the hospitality industry, French Quarter residents and city government. The FQMD has been extremely influential in the renewal process for the tax, and was given explicit administrative authority over the funds it will generate through the April ballot measure. In July, as council members were preparing to reinstate the tax, the FQMD asked Palmer to delay the tax by three months due to uncertainty over the legality of the hotel exemption. The request to delay was criticized by one FQMD board member, who said that it was bad for public safety and called the FQMD a “business dominated board.” The result of Thursday’s vote is that businesses will be required to collect the tax beginning in October. But before any of the money is actually spent, the city needs to finalize a cooperative endeavor agreement between Mayor Cantrell, the FQEDD and the FQMD.\\xa0 The hotel exemption Thursday’s meeting didn’t include any public discussion about why hotel room sales were being exempted from the tax. In an interview after the meeting, Palmer defended the exemption, saying that hotel room sales are already subject to a number of special taxes that don’t apply to other businesses.\\xa0 “The hotel rooms pay additional taxes over and beyond what the regular sales tax is,” Palmer said. “So this would be considered like a triple tax.” She also emphasized that the exemption was only for hotel room rentals, and that other sales at hotels, like at hotel bars or restaurants, would still be subject to the tax.\\xa0 But Palmer didn’t have a complete rebuttal to the legal concerns raised by the city and State Bond Commission. Her only explanation was that the exemption was a matter of precedent.\\xa0 “The precedent is established because it’s been that way for the past five years,” she said. “That was always the agreement and always the arrangement.” The French Quarter public safety tax, sometimes referred to as the “quarter for the quarter,” was first approved by French Quarter residents in 2015 and went into effect in 2016. From 2016 until 2020, the funds were exclusively used to pay for additional patrols in the neighborhood by the Louisiana State Police.\\xa0 Hotel room sales were exempt from that tax. The exemption wasn’t explicitly included in the 2015 ballot measure, but was later implemented through a FQEDD resolution at a 2016 meeting. As The Lens previously reported, the legal justification for that decision wasn’t mentioned during that meeting, nor any other FQEDD meeting in 2015 or 2016.

This story has been updated to reflect that the French Quarter Management District has removed a discussion about erroneously collected taxes from its upcoming meeting agenda.',\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    'The New Orleans City Council’s two-day, mid-year city budget hearings got off to a rocky start on Monday when Councilman Jared Brossett accused Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration of refusing to participate. “Although they were given adequate notice, the administration has continued to refuse to participate in these hearings in good faith,” Brossett said. “This is not acceptable.” The agenda for Monday’s meeting originally included 13 departmental presentations and was scheduled to last nine hours. Instead, the council heard just two presentations in under two hours — one relatively lengthy one from Chief Administrative Officer Gilbert Montaño and a brief one from the Civil Service Department.\\xa0 Councilman Brossett had requested that each city department and agency present a “comprehensive update of their 2021 budget,” as well as their planned expenditures using federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act and a list of coronavirus-related expenses incurred so far this year.\\xa0\\xa0 Montaño admitted that he didn’t have all that information ready on Monday, but said that his presentation was an attempt to fill the council in on the most important questions surrounding\\xa0 the city’s budget. “The administration’s presentation will not provide what you or your team has requested at this time,” he said. “The administration certainly does not agree with your characterization or sentiment. In fact we think that participating in good faith is ultimately what we’re doing.” Although he didn’t bring all the information Brossett asked for, Montaño did outline key information related to a central request from Brossett — an explanation of how the city plans to use $388 million in federal aid provided through the federal American Rescue Plan Act, the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package passed in March. Montaño laid out the administration’s plans to use those funds to boost this year’s budget by $70 million — the first allocation of the federal dollars. The money would go to fill gaps in the 2021 budget, which was about $100 million lower than what the city had expected prior to pandemic-related revenue shortfalls.\\xa0 According to Montaño’s presentation, the $70 million would be used on a number of initiatives, including increased overtime pay for public safety agencies, license plate readers, restorative justice programs, early childhood education, short-term rental enforcement, illegal dumping alleviation and to “rebuild” the City Planning Commission staff. The allocation would need City Council approval and Montaño said he expects to bring the issue back to the council with more comprehensive information in September.\\xa0 The kind of comprehensive mid-year budget hearings Brossett requested are not typical. The City Council often receives mid-year budget updates on certain public safety agencies. But the kind of citywide, department-by-department presentations Brossett was seeking usually occur in the fall as the city sets its annual budget for the upcoming year.\\xa0 But this is not a typical year, Brossett argued, and it calls for increased scrutiny as the city deals with deep financial losses on the one hand, and hundreds of millions in federal aid on the other.\\xa0 “We will all have to make difficult decisions both now and in the future based on the fiscal realities of the city,” Brossett said. Montaño’s resistance to the mid-year budget presentations wasn’t a surprise. He told Brossett as much in a July 19 letter that was previously reported by The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate.\\xa0 On Monday, Montaño repeated his objections to the hearings, including that fulfilling Brossett’s entire request would get in the way of the administration’s preparations for passing the 2022 budget.\\xa0 “The 2022 budget will be one of the most consequential budgets for the future of New Orleans,” he said. “Unfortunately the timing of the request for these hearings could jeopardize the natural budget cycle designed to accommodate this process. That is not something we’re willing to risk based on an artificial timeline created.” American Rescue Plan spending One of the points of contention between Brossett and the Cantrell administration is over a lack of a clear plan for how the city will spend the funds from the American Rescue Plan. The city has actually received $194 million so far, of the $388 million total it expects. “The CAO and [chief financial officer] have provided little to no information regarding their proposed plans for American Rescue Plan funds,” Brossett said on Monday “We find this problematic.” Brossett told Montaño he wanted to see a list of exactly how the money would be spent. But Montaño said that likely wouldn’t happen. “There will never be a list that matches $194 million with $194 million of expenditures,” Montaño said.\\xa0 As he’s explained in the past, the city’s approach is to spread the Rescue Plan funds through 2025 to account for sustained, lingering financial impacts from the pandemic. The city has estimated that recurring revenue will only get back to pre-pandemic levels in 2025.\\xa0 The Cantrell administration measures the city’s fiscal health in terms of recurring revenue — revenue sources like property taxes that the city can rely on to come in every year, as opposed to one-time funds like federal stimulus money that likely won’t be available in future years.\\xa0 Montaño said that lingering uncertainties, including the highly infectious delta variant of the coronavirus — which has led to a new statewide mask mandate — make it nearly impossible to estimate exactly what needs the city will have to fill over the next four years. He did, however, present on how the administration plans to use the money to bolster the 2021 budget.“We don’t see the ARP funding as an additional windfall for the city,” Montaño said. “Instead we view these funds as a way to close the gaps in the city’s continued projected revenue loss through 2025 when we expect the city to fully recover. There is debate on that 2025 recovery period, and there’s now a variable with the delta variant, but we’re maintaining conservative estimates and keeping it at 2025.” The administration plans to ask the City Council in September to approve an ordinance to allocate the first $70 million. Montaño broke down the uses of the money into four categories —\\xa0”crime and public safety,” “new initiatives focused on public safety,” “restore government operations” and “improve quality of life.”\\xa0 The “crime and public safety” category largely revolves around increasing personnel at the New Orleans Police Department, fire department and EMS. That includes $11 million for increased overtime at those three agencies and $300,000 for NOPD patrol officer promotions. Another $8 million would go to the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office to pay for mental health services for inmates. The city would also use $1 million to buy an additional 150 to 160 new license plate readers for crime reduction, particularly in eastern New Orleans. The request will also include increased funding for the SPCA.\\xa0 The “new initiatives focused on public safety” category includes less traditional public safety initiatives. That includes creating a non-law enforcement behavioral health crisis response unit to answer some 911 calls. The initiative would include in-patient care, a crisis stabilization facility and ongoing outpatient care. “This is, we feel, the future of many police departments as far as strategies,” Montaño said. “You see this happening throughout the country.” Money would also be invested in a partnership between the District Attorney’s Office and the Center for Restorative Approaches to create a restorative justice program. The three-year pilot program would seek to divert 560 cases from criminal proceedings. The city also plans to spend money on the Municipal Court Mental Health Unit — a program operated by the Orleans Public Defenders that seeks to get mental health services to people who regularly cycle in and out of the court system due to mental illness. The third category of the $70 million dedication is restoring governmental operations.\\xa0 Montaño said this money would be used to reimburse city employees for furloughs that were put in place in late 2020 as a cost saving measure and ended in early 2021. The city would also buy new vehicles for public safety agencies and the Department of Public Works.\\xa0 Also in that third category is new personnel funding. The administration wants to hire five new short-term rental enforcement employees in the Department of Safety and Permits, as well as a dedicated short-term rental attorney. Code Enforcement would get another four employees for the lot abatement program. Montaño said the money would also go to “rebuild” the City Planning Commission staff, although he said a staffing plan is still in the works.\\xa0 Funding for the quality-of-life category includes $4 million for the administration’s anti-blight and litter initiative, CleanUp NOLA, as well as $1.5 million to fund another 112 seats in early childhood education programs. The money would also be used to pay down the long list of court judgements against the city.\\xa0',\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    'The New Orleans City Council’s two-day, mid-year city budget hearings got off to a rocky start on Monday when Councilman Jared Brossett accused Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration of refusing to participate. “Although they were given adequate notice, the administration has continued to refuse to participate in these hearings in good faith,” Brossett said. “This is not acceptable.” The agenda for Monday’s meeting originally included 13 departmental presentations and was scheduled to last nine hours.

Montaño said the money would also go to “rebuild” the City Planning Commission staff, although he said a staffing plan is still in the works.\\xa0 Funding for the quality-of-life category includes $4 million for the administration’s anti-blight and litter initiative, CleanUp NOLA, as well as $1.5 million to fund another 112 seats in early childhood education programs.

Instead, the council heard just two presentations in under two hours — one relatively lengthy one from Chief Administrative Officer Gilbert Montaño and a brief one from the Civil Service Department.\\xa0 Councilman Brossett had requested that each city department and agency present a “comprehensive update of their 2021 budget,” as well as their planned expenditures using federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act and a list of coronavirus-related expenses incurred so far this year.\\xa0\\xa0 Montaño admitted that he didn’t have all that information ready on Monday, but said that his presentation was an attempt to fill the council in on the most important questions surrounding\\xa0 the city’s budget. “The administration’s presentation will not provide what you or your team has requested at this time,” he said. “The administration certainly does not agree with your characterization or sentiment. In fact we think that participating in good faith is ultimately what we’re doing.” Although he didn’t bring all the information Brossett asked for, Montaño did outline key information related to a central request from Brossett — an explanation of how the city plans to use $388 million in federal aid provided through the federal American Rescue Plan Act, the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package passed in March. Montaño laid out the administration’s plans to use those funds to boost this year’s budget by $70 million — the first allocation of the federal dollars. The money would go to fill gaps in the 2021 budget, which was about $100 million lower than what the city had expected prior to pandemic-related revenue shortfalls.\\xa0 According to Montaño’s presentation, the $70 million would be used on a number of initiatives, including increased overtime pay for public safety agencies, license plate readers, restorative justice programs, early childhood education, short-term rental enforcement, illegal dumping alleviation and to “rebuild” the City Planning Commission staff. The allocation would need City Council approval and Montaño said he expects to bring the issue back to the council with more comprehensive information in September.\\xa0 The kind of comprehensive mid-year budget hearings Brossett requested are not typical. The City Council often receives mid-year budget updates on certain public safety agencies. But the kind of citywide, department-by-department presentations Brossett was seeking usually occur in the fall as the city sets its annual budget for the upcoming year.\\xa0 But this is not a typical year, Brossett argued, and it calls for increased scrutiny as the city deals with deep financial losses on the one hand, and hundreds of millions in federal aid on the other.\\xa0 “We will all have to make difficult decisions both now and in the future based on the fiscal realities of the city,” Brossett said. Montaño’s resistance to the mid-year budget presentations wasn’t a surprise. He told Brossett as much in a July 19 letter that was previously reported by The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate.\\xa0 On Monday, Montaño repeated his objections to the hearings, including that fulfilling Brossett’s entire request would get in the way of the administration’s preparations for passing the 2022 budget.\\xa0 “The 2022 budget will be one of the most consequential budgets for the future of New Orleans,” he said. “Unfortunately the timing of the request for these hearings could jeopardize the natural budget cycle designed to accommodate this process. That is not something we’re willing to risk based on an artificial timeline created.” American Rescue Plan spending One of the points of contention between Brossett and the Cantrell administration is over a lack of a clear plan for how the city will spend the funds from the American Rescue Plan. The city has actually received $194 million so far, of the $388 million total it expects. “The CAO and [chief financial officer] have provided little to no information regarding their proposed plans for American Rescue Plan funds,” Brossett said on Monday “We find this problematic.” Brossett told Montaño he wanted to see a list of exactly how the money would be spent. But Montaño said that likely wouldn’t happen. “There will never be a list that matches $194 million with $194 million of expenditures,” Montaño said.\\xa0 As he’s explained in the past, the city’s approach is to spread the Rescue Plan funds through 2025 to account for sustained, lingering financial impacts from the pandemic. The city has estimated that recurring revenue will only get back to pre-pandemic levels in 2025.\\xa0 The Cantrell administration measures the city’s fiscal health in terms of recurring revenue — revenue sources like property taxes that the city can rely on to come in every year, as opposed to one-time funds like federal stimulus money that likely won’t be available in future years.\\xa0 Montaño said that lingering uncertainties, including the highly infectious delta variant of the coronavirus — which has led to a new statewide mask mandate — make it nearly impossible to estimate exactly what needs the city will have to fill over the next four years. He did, however, present on how the administration plans to use the money to bolster the 2021 budget.“We don’t see the ARP funding as an additional windfall for the city,” Montaño said. “Instead we view these funds as a way to close the gaps in the city’s continued projected revenue loss through 2025 when we expect the city to fully recover. There is debate on that 2025 recovery period, and there’s now a variable with the delta variant, but we’re maintaining conservative estimates and keeping it at 2025.” The administration plans to ask the City Council in September to approve an ordinance to allocate the first $70 million. Montaño broke down the uses of the money into four categories —\\xa0”crime and public safety,” “new initiatives focused on public safety,” “restore government operations” and “improve quality of life.”\\xa0 The “crime and public safety” category largely revolves around increasing personnel at the New Orleans Police Department, fire department and EMS. That includes $11 million for increased overtime at those three agencies and $300,000 for NOPD patrol officer promotions. Another $8 million would go to the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office to pay for mental health services for inmates. The city would also use $1 million to buy an additional 150 to 160 new license plate readers for crime reduction, particularly in eastern New Orleans. The request will also include increased funding for the SPCA.\\xa0 The “new initiatives focused on public safety” category includes less traditional public safety initiatives. That includes creating a non-law enforcement behavioral health crisis response unit to answer some 911 calls. The initiative would include in-patient care, a crisis stabilization facility and ongoing outpatient care. “This is, we feel, the future of many police departments as far as strategies,” Montaño said. “You see this happening throughout the country.” Money would also be invested in a partnership between the District Attorney’s Office and the Center for Restorative Approaches to create a restorative justice program. The three-year pilot program would seek to divert 560 cases from criminal proceedings. The city also plans to spend money on the Municipal Court Mental Health Unit — a program operated by the Orleans Public Defenders that seeks to get mental health services to people who regularly cycle in and out of the court system due to mental illness. The third category of the $70 million dedication is restoring governmental operations.\\xa0 Montaño said this money would be used to reimburse city employees for furloughs that were put in place in late 2020 as a cost saving measure and ended in early 2021. The city would also buy new vehicles for public safety agencies and the Department of Public Works.\\xa0 Also in that third category is new personnel funding. The administration wants to hire five new short-term rental enforcement employees in the Department of Safety and Permits, as well as a dedicated short-term rental attorney. Code Enforcement would get another four employees for the lot abatement program. Montaño said the money would also go to “rebuild” the City Planning Commission staff, although he said a staffing plan is still in the works.\\xa0 Funding for the quality-of-life category includes $4 million for the administration’s anti-blight and litter initiative, CleanUp NOLA, as well as $1.5 million to fund another 112 seats in early childhood education programs.

Instead, the council heard just two presentations in under two hours — one relatively lengthy one from Chief Administrative Officer Gilbert Montaño and a brief one from the Civil Service Department.\\xa0 Councilman Brossett had requested that each city department and agency present a “comprehensive update of their 2021 budget,” as well as their planned expenditures using federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act and a list of coronavirus-related expenses incurred so far this year.\\xa0\\xa0 Montaño admitted that he didn’t have all that information ready on Monday, but said that his presentation was an attempt to fill the council in on the most important questions surrounding\\xa0 the city’s budget. “The administration’s presentation will not provide what you or your team has requested at this time,” he said. “The administration certainly does not agree with your characterization or sentiment. In fact we think that participating in good faith is ultimately what we’re doing.” Although he didn’t bring all the information Brossett asked for, Montaño did outline key information related to a central request from Brossett — an explanation of how the city plans to use $388 million in federal aid provided through the federal American Rescue Plan Act, the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package passed in March. Montaño laid out the administration’s plans to use those funds to boost this year’s budget by $70 million — the first allocation of the federal dollars. The money would go to fill gaps in the 2021 budget, which was about $100 million lower than what the city had expected prior to pandemic-related revenue shortfalls.\\xa0 According to Montaño’s presentation, the $70 million would be used on a number of initiatives, including increased overtime pay for public safety agencies, license plate readers, restorative justice programs, early childhood education, short-term rental enforcement, illegal dumping alleviation and to “rebuild” the City Planning Commission staff. The allocation would need City Council approval and Montaño said he expects to bring the issue back to the council with more comprehensive information in September.\\xa0 The kind of comprehensive mid-year budget hearings Brossett requested are not typical. The City Council often receives mid-year budget updates on certain public safety agencies. But the kind of citywide, department-by-department presentations Brossett was seeking usually occur in the fall as the city sets its annual budget for the upcoming year.\\xa0 But this is not a typical year, Brossett argued, and it calls for increased scrutiny as the city deals with deep financial losses on the one hand, and hundreds of millions in federal aid on the other.\\xa0 “We will all have to make difficult decisions both now and in the future based on the fiscal realities of the city,” Brossett said. Montaño’s resistance to the mid-year budget presentations wasn’t a surprise. He told Brossett as much in a July 19 letter that was previously reported by The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate.\\xa0 On Monday, Montaño repeated his objections to the hearings, including that fulfilling Brossett’s entire request would get in the way of the administration’s preparations for passing the 2022 budget.\\xa0 “The 2022 budget will be one of the most consequential budgets for the future of New Orleans,” he said. “Unfortunately the timing of the request for these hearings could jeopardize the natural budget cycle designed to accommodate this process. That is not something we’re willing to risk based on an artificial timeline created.” American Rescue Plan spending One of the points of contention between Brossett and the Cantrell administration is over a lack of a clear plan for how the city will spend the funds from the American Rescue Plan. The city has actually received $194 million so far, of the $388 million total it expects. “The CAO and [chief financial officer] have provided little to no information regarding their proposed plans for American Rescue Plan funds,” Brossett said on Monday “We find this problematic.” Brossett told Montaño he wanted to see a list of exactly how the money would be spent. But Montaño said that likely wouldn’t happen. “There will never be a list that matches $194 million with $194 million of expenditures,” Montaño said.\\xa0 As he’s explained in the past, the city’s approach is to spread the Rescue Plan funds through 2025 to account for sustained, lingering financial impacts from the pandemic. The city has estimated that recurring revenue will only get back to pre-pandemic levels in 2025.\\xa0 The Cantrell administration measures the city’s fiscal health in terms of recurring revenue — revenue sources like property taxes that the city can rely on to come in every year, as opposed to one-time funds like federal stimulus money that likely won’t be available in future years.\\xa0 Montaño said that lingering uncertainties, including the highly infectious delta variant of the coronavirus — which has led to a new statewide mask mandate — make it nearly impossible to estimate exactly what needs the city will have to fill over the next four years. He did, however, present on how the administration plans to use the money to bolster the 2021 budget.“We don’t see the ARP funding as an additional windfall for the city,” Montaño said. “Instead we view these funds as a way to close the gaps in the city’s continued projected revenue loss through 2025 when we expect the city to fully recover. There is debate on that 2025 recovery period, and there’s now a variable with the delta variant, but we’re maintaining conservative estimates and keeping it at 2025.” The administration plans to ask the City Council in September to approve an ordinance to allocate the first $70 million. Montaño broke down the uses of the money into four categories —\\xa0”crime and public safety,” “new initiatives focused on public safety,” “restore government operations” and “improve quality of life.”\\xa0 The “crime and public safety” category largely revolves around increasing personnel at the New Orleans Police Department, fire department and EMS. That includes $11 million for increased overtime at those three agencies and $300,000 for NOPD patrol officer promotions. Another $8 million would go to the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office to pay for mental health services for inmates. The city would also use $1 million to buy an additional 150 to 160 new license plate readers for crime reduction, particularly in eastern New Orleans. The request will also include increased funding for the SPCA.\\xa0 The “new initiatives focused on public safety” category includes less traditional public safety initiatives. That includes creating a non-law enforcement behavioral health crisis response unit to answer some 911 calls. The initiative would include in-patient care, a crisis stabilization facility and ongoing outpatient care. “This is, we feel, the future of many police departments as far as strategies,” Montaño said. “You see this happening throughout the country.” Money would also be invested in a partnership between the District Attorney’s Office and the Center for Restorative Approaches to create a restorative justice program. The three-year pilot program would seek to divert 560 cases from criminal proceedings. The city also plans to spend money on the Municipal Court Mental Health Unit — a program operated by the Orleans Public Defenders that seeks to get mental health services to people who regularly cycle in and out of the court system due to mental illness. The third category of the $70 million dedication is restoring governmental operations.\\xa0 Montaño said this money would be used to reimburse city employees for furloughs that were put in place in late 2020 as a cost saving measure and ended in early 2021. The city would also buy new vehicles for public safety agencies and the Department of Public Works.\\xa0 Also in that third category is new personnel funding. The administration wants to hire five new short-term rental enforcement employees in the Department of Safety and Permits, as well as a dedicated short-term rental attorney. Code Enforcement would get another four employees for the lot abatement program. Montaño said the money would also go to “rebuild” the City Planning Commission staff, although he said a staffing plan is still in the works.\\xa0 Funding for the quality-of-life category includes $4 million for the administration’s anti-blight and litter initiative, CleanUp NOLA, as well as $1.5 million to fund another 112 seats in early childhood education programs. The money would also be used to pay down the long list of court judgements against the city.\\xa0',\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           'After more than a year of virtual meetings in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Orleans Parish School Board members on Tuesday held their first in-person committee meeting since\\xa0 March 2020. They were met with a socially distanced — but filled to capacity — room of Alfred Lawless High School alumni.\\xa0 Boardroom seating for the public was limited to 23 spaced chairs. Many other people watched the meeting from an overflow area. Board members’ traditional podium style seating was separated into two stadium style rows with plexiglass barriers, as the city endures a fourth and rather alarming spike in COVID-19 cases.\\xa0 The Lawless alumni were there to advocate for the board to restore the school’s name to its Law Street* property — which was renamed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Charter School when the Friends of King charter group moved into the facility in 2015. (Shortly after that, the board banned the naming of buildings for charter schools.) “Lawless is just not a building, it’s a fiber, it’s who we are,” said class of 1984 graduate Randolph Davis. Rev. Brenda Square also supported the change, noting that Lawless, who served as principal of Fisk Colored School, was a strong advocate for the education for the city’s Black students in the early 20th Century.\\xa0 “Replacing Alfred Lawless with Martin Luther King would suggest we have no local leaders with stories worth recognition,” Square said. “His ministry was the foundation on which Martin Luther King himself was propelled forward. This history of Black education is rooted in the Lawless legacy.” The proposal for the school building to return to its historic name comes as the board is separately working on removing longtime school names from dozens of other campuses. In those other cases, the schools were named after people who were Confederate sympathizers, owned slaves or supported school segregation.\\xa0 All speakers but one were supportive of the Lawless proposal, which would only rename the facility — not the charter school using it. That was Joseph Recasner, a King charter school employee, who suggested a compromise.\\xa0 “We are in total agreement that the name of Alfred Lawless should be on King high school,” he said. “It should be on there as the Dr. Martin Luther King Charter School at Alfred Lawless.” The board committee approved the name change, along with new names for five additional buildings.Bethune Elementary will be renamed for Enrique Alferez and the Stuart Bradley campus will be renamed Mary Mcleod Bethune, where the charter named for Bethune now resides. Lake Area High School will be renamed after John F. Kennedy, the school recently renamed itself after Kennedy and has been working with its alumni group. Village de l’Est will be renamed for Dominic Mai Thanh Luong and Arthur Ashe will be renamed for Vorice Jackson-Waters. COVID-19 operations Chief Operations Officer Tiffany Delcour told board members on Tuesday that the NOLA Public Schools district will continue COVID-19 vaccine drives and testing as it prepares for the new school year.\\xa0 They are also watching the city’s case data closely, she said, noting the district had already re-imposed a mask requirement for all students, after first planning to only require masks for unvaccinated students and employees. The announcement came after New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell instituted an indoor mask “advisory” last week, strongly recommending masks in public places regardless of vaccination status. The CDC made similar recommendations this week.\\xa0 “As we know with COVID-19, the only thing we know is a given is change,” Delcour said. “We’ve added a new section to our guidance, ‘temporary operational procedures.’ ” Delcour said the district is also working to develop a small financial incentive to encourage eligible students to get the vaccine. Details on that program weren’t immediately clear. The district is partnering with the Louisiana Department of Health to bring weekly testing to any interested school for the upcoming school year. “We will be participating in one of their largest weekly routine testing projects,” Delcour said. Board members Katie Baudouin and Olin Parker offered a few suggestions. “At some point we might need to start thinking about requiring vaccines, or requiring testing,” Baudouin said. “I’m glad we’re starting with incentives.” Parker suggested the district make student testing the default — asking families to “opt-out” rather than an “opt-in” — to increase participation.\\xa0 Myrialis King, CEO of charter school operator Community Academies of New Orleans, attended the meeting and told members about a Monday vaccine drive.\\xa0 “The first four people I saw were people who said they would not get the vaccine in May.” Board member J.C. Romero asked about virtual school as an option for students. District Chief of Staff Mary Garton* said it would be offered on a limited basis.\\xa0 “We want kids in school,” she said. “Students and families have always had the option in acute or specific medical situations for virtual instruction,” she said. “We are not offering virtual instruction on a broad scale.” Attendance rates suffered during virtual schooling last school year. Finance and policy Also at Tuesday’s meeting, district Chief Financial Officer Stuart Gay presented monthly financials and introduced the 2021-2022 school year budget. The budget varies quite a bit from previous years in certain areas, in part because the district is no longer directly operating any schools. Its one remaining “direct-run” school, Mary D. Coghill School, transferred to the Hynes Charter School group. Gay explained several line items look different due to classification errors discovered during the district’s annual financial audit, which is about seven months past its initial deadline. “Ink is drying on the audit as we speak, and it will be submitted by the end of this week,” Gay said, noting the district had received another extension. “We have seven audit findings.” Auditors outlined those findings earlier this year. The committee also voted to increase the auditors’ contract to $250,000 due to extra work required to complete this year’s audit, Gay said. It is expected to be $125,000 next year. Schools will still feel the pandemic in their budgets this year, Gay said, with per-pupil funding forecast to drop from $9,423 per student to $9,069. He also estimates schools will see $500 negative deferred revenue per pupil as they did last school year.\\xa0 “This is a tough year,” Gay said. “We’re looking forward to 2022.” “The sales tax rebound is really what we’re looking for, we’re hoping everyone gets vaccinated and everyone stays safe because it has an absolute effect on the resources available to students,” he said. Legislative consultant Rodney Braxton briefly reviewed laws passed during the last legislative session. He highlighted the legalization of sports betting, noting it will eventually bring some revenue to state per-pupil funding and early childhood education. Additionally, a bill from Sen. Joe Bouie written to restore the School Board’s ability to vote on charter schools passed. This bill removed language from state law that required a “two-thirds vote of full membership” to override the superintendent’s recommendation.\\xa0 “It basically returns the authority so that you can follow your own policy,” Braxton said. The board’s policy, however, still requires a two-thirds vote. This could come into play Thursday when the superintendent is expected to recommend the revocation of the Dryades YMCA’s charter contract for James M. Singleton Charter School. The YMCA and district are participating in court-ordered mediation. Board member Carlos Zervigon thanked Bouie for working with the board on crafting the bill. Board President Ethan Ashley also updated board members on the superintendent search. Last month, Lewis announced he would not seek a contract renewal when his contract expires at the end June in 2022. The board will hold a work session Thursday to discuss what they’d like to see in a search firm and then develop an RFP to find such a contractor.

They were met with a socially distanced — but filled to capacity — room of Alfred Lawless High School alumni.\\xa0 Boardroom seating for the public was limited to 23 spaced chairs. Many other people watched the meeting from an overflow area. Board members’ traditional podium style seating was separated into two stadium style rows with plexiglass barriers, as the city endures a fourth and rather alarming spike in COVID-19 cases.\\xa0 The Lawless alumni were there to advocate for the board to restore the school’s name to its Law Street* property — which was renamed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Charter School when the Friends of King charter group moved into the facility in 2015. (Shortly after that, the board banned the naming of buildings for charter schools.) “Lawless is just not a building, it’s a fiber, it’s who we are,” said class of 1984 graduate Randolph Davis. Rev. Brenda Square also supported the change, noting that Lawless, who served as principal of Fisk Colored School, was a strong advocate for the education for the city’s Black students in the early 20th Century.\\xa0 “Replacing Alfred Lawless with Martin Luther King would suggest we have no local leaders with stories worth recognition,” Square said. “His ministry was the foundation on which Martin Luther King himself was propelled forward. This history of Black education is rooted in the Lawless legacy.” The proposal for the school building to return to its historic name comes as the board is separately working on removing longtime school names from dozens of other campuses. In those other cases, the schools were named after people who were Confederate sympathizers, owned slaves or supported school segregation.\\xa0 All speakers but one were supportive of the Lawless proposal, which would only rename the facility — not the charter school using it. That was Joseph Recasner, a King charter school employee, who suggested a compromise.\\xa0 “We are in total agreement that the name of Alfred Lawless should be on King high school,” he said. “It should be on there as the Dr. Martin Luther King Charter School at Alfred Lawless.” The board committee approved the name change, along with new names for five additional buildings.Bethune Elementary will be renamed for Enrique Alferez and the Stuart Bradley campus will be renamed Mary Mcleod Bethune, where the charter named for Bethune now resides. Lake Area High School will be renamed after John F. Kennedy, the school recently renamed itself after Kennedy and has been working with its alumni group. Village de l’Est will be renamed for Dominic Mai Thanh Luong and Arthur Ashe will be renamed for Vorice Jackson-Waters. COVID-19 operations Chief Operations Officer Tiffany Delcour told board members on Tuesday that the NOLA Public Schools district will continue COVID-19 vaccine drives and testing as it prepares for the new school year.\\xa0 They are also watching the city’s case data closely, she said, noting the district had already re-imposed a mask requirement for all students, after first planning to only require masks for unvaccinated students and employees. The announcement came after New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell instituted an indoor mask “advisory” last week, strongly recommending masks in public places regardless of vaccination status. The CDC made similar recommendations this week.\\xa0 “As we know with COVID-19, the only thing we know is a given is change,” Delcour said. “We’ve added a new section to our guidance, ‘temporary operational procedures.’ ” Delcour said the district is also working to develop a small financial incentive to encourage eligible students to get the vaccine. Details on that program weren’t immediately clear. The district is partnering with the Louisiana Department of Health to bring weekly testing to any interested school for the upcoming school year. “We will be participating in one of their largest weekly routine testing projects,” Delcour said. Board members Katie Baudouin and Olin Parker offered a few suggestions. “At some point we might need to start thinking about requiring vaccines, or requiring testing,” Baudouin said. “I’m glad we’re starting with incentives.” Parker suggested the district make student testing the default — asking families to “opt-out” rather than an “opt-in” — to increase participation.\\xa0 Myrialis King, CEO of charter school operator Community Academies of New Orleans, attended the meeting and told members about a Monday vaccine drive.\\xa0 “The first four people I saw were people who said they would not get the vaccine in May.” Board member J.C.

Bids deemed outside of a certain range typically trigger a more extensive review. DOTD will continue to monitor increases in bid prices related to supply chain and workforce issues. After a review, DOTD may opt to have the project re-bid. Construction projects are prioritized by road/bridge condition, urgency of improvements, type/volume of traffic, crash records, unforeseeable emergencies that caused damage, and several other factors.

Respond to these ideas or create your own record in any form you desire, including poetry, painting, photography and collage. Responses will be compiled into a zine publication to be released before the exhibition closes.

California to J.B. and Avrice Jefferies, passed away peacefully on April 12, 2022, at Calcutta House, a hospice facility, surrounded by his loving family after a long journey with dementia. A memorial service will be conducted at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, April 19, 2022, at Pellerin Funeral Home in New Iberia, with visitation from 9 a.m. until 11 a.m. Interment will follow at Beau Pre Cemetery. Fr. Buddy Breaux and Rev. David Denton will officiate. Gene is survived by his wife Junelle G. Jefferies of Loreauville; children Deborah Schwing (Edmond “Beaver”) of New Iberia, Marilyn Bourgeois (David) of New Iberia, Jan DuBois (David) of Kingsland, Georgia and Joe Jefferies (Gretchen) of Friendswood, Texas; two bonus children, Charlotte S. Chaplin (David) of Baton Rouge and Susan Hunsaker (John) of Alexandria; brother Dan Jefferies (Nancy) of Phoenix, Arizona; grandchildren Aaron Schwing, Caroline Schwing Courtois (Joshua), Nicholas Bourgeois (Camille), Blake Bourgeois (Betsy), Garett Bourgeois, Kali Weisz (Derek), Kelsey Kelley (Joel), Parker DuBois (Randi Jo), Spencer Jefferies, Mitchell Jefferies and Drew Jefferies; two bonus grandchildren, Daniel Hunsaker and Luke Hunsaker; and 14 great-grandchildren. Gene was preceded in death by his parents J.B. and Avrice Jefferies; his first wife, LaVonna Manning Jefferies; brother Boyd Jefferies; sister Pauline Wood; and grandson Austin J. Schwing. Gene managed several cattle ranches before completing his undergraduate degree in Animal Science from Arizona State University and his master’s degree in Agricultural Economics from University of Arizona. He began his career in Brazil and later in Venezuela working in agricultural research and development for the U.S. Peace Corps, U.S. Agency for International Development and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. Gene moved to New Iberia in 1977, where he was employed by McIlhenny Company as Director of Agricultural Operations, a position he held for 22 years before retiring in 1999. While at McIlhenny, Paul Bosland, Director of the Chili Pepper Institute wrote, “Gene’s travels and adventures have made him a great leader with worldly experience, offering new insights and has been instrumental in the globalization of peppers.” Gene was a member of the New Iberia Kiwanis Club, serving as a director, vice-president, president and Division Lt. Governor. He was also a volunteer member of the Louisiana Chapter of the Partners of the Americas where he served in Haiti and El Salvador. In 2009, he was appointed as Loreauville’s representative to the Port of Iberia as a Port Commissioner. Additionally, Gene was involved with New Iberia’s Ancient Order of Creole Gourmets, Newcomers’ Club, ULL Life Writing classes and achieved Life Master status as a bridge player. Gene loved nothing more than sitting on the back porch with a glass of wine, enjoying nature and visiting with family and friends. He was a great story teller and a man of integrity who was loved and respected by all who knew him. The family would like to express our deep appreciation and gratitude to those who helped in so many ways during Gene’s last years of life. We also want to thank Dr. Jude Theriot, Palliative Care and Hospice of Acadiana for their compassionate care and guidance.

district will choose whether to add a half-cent sales tax to purchases that will pay for local school construction projects. The election will be held April 30, with early voting scheduled to begin Saturday. The sales tax is projected to raise about $300,000 annually, according to Livingston Parish School officials. “This funding will make a big difference in the Albany School District’s ability to address facility needs,” said Livingston Parish School Board Member Devin Gregoire, who occupies the District 9 board seat representing the Albany area. Proposed school construction projects include a new track and field facility and elementary cafeteria for the Albany School complex. “All of the dollars earned from this half-cent project will remain in the Albany School District, and those construction projects we are proposing are much needed and have been asked for by local citizens for some time,” Gregoire said. The proposition will only be available to voters living in the Albany School taxing district.',\\n

    'Voters in the Albany School tax district will choose whether to add a half-cent sales tax to purchases that will pay for local school construction projects. The election will be held April 30, with early voting underway. The sales tax is projected to raise about $300,000 annually, according to Livingston Parish School officials. “This funding will make a big difference in the Albany School District’s ability to address facility needs,” said Livingston Parish School Board Member Devin Gregoire, who occupies the District 9 board seat representing the Albany area. Proposed school construction projects include a new track and field facility and elementary cafeteria for the Albany School complex. “All of the dollars earned from this half-cent project will remain in the Albany School District, and those construction projects we are proposing are much needed and have been asked for by local citizens for some time,” Gregoire said. The proposition will only be available to voters living in the Albany School taxing district.',\\n

II. Musical impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber learned that the Queen&#x27;s favourite song is satirical Cole Porter number &#x27;Miss Otis Regrets&#x27; and arranged for the star to perform it for the monarch, 95, at a private event to mark her Diamond Jubilee back in 2012. He told the Daily Mail: &quot;I was involved in organising the entertainment for the Queen&#x27;s last Jubilee and we had a private evening. I got Jessie to come and do the song &#x27;Miss Otis Regrets&#x27;, as that is a favourite; and some Rodgers and Hammerstein numbers which I had been told Her Majesty liked.&quot; The legendary composer went on to explain that Jessie - who recently won an Olivier award for her role as Sally Bowles in the critically acclaimed West End revival of &#x27;Cabaret&#x27; - was unfazed by singing &quot;two feet away&quot; from the Queen and described her performance as &quot;wonderful.&quot; He said: &quot;Jessie was singing about two feet away from the Queen. Any performer would have been intimidated, but not a bit of it. She was wonderful&quot; The 32-year-old actress - who recently won an Olivier award for her role as Sally Bowles in the critically acclaimed West End revival of &#x27;Cabaret&#x27; - was discovered by Lord Webber as an 18-year-old when she auditioned for his BBC talent show &#x27;I&#x27;d Do Anything&#x27; back in 2008, which sought to find an actress to play Nancy in his West End revival of Oliver! Despite being a favourite to win the series, Jessie eventually came runner up to Jodie Prenger on the show and the composer went on to claim that losing out on the role was the &quot;best possible&quot; outcome for the Oscar-nominated star. He said: &quot;I got to know her pretty well after the TV show. I think, in a way, her not winning it was the best possible thing that could have happened.&quot;',\\n

Musical impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber learned that the Queen&#x27;s favourite song is satirical Cole Porter number &#x27;Miss Otis Regrets&#x27; and arranged for the star to perform it for the monarch, 95, at a private event to mark her Diamond Jubilee back in 2012. He told the Daily Mail: &quot;I was involved in organising the entertainment for the Queen&#x27;s last Jubilee and we had a private evening. I got Jessie to come and do the song &#x27;Miss Otis Regrets&#x27;, as that is a favourite; and some Rodgers and Hammerstein numbers which I had been told Her Majesty liked.&quot; The legendary composer went on to explain that Jessie was unfazed by singing &quot;two feet away&quot; from the Queen and described her performance as &quot;wonderful.&quot; He said: &quot;Jessie was singing about two feet away from the Queen. Any performer would have been intimidated, but not a bit of it. She was wonderful&quot; The 32-year-old actress - who recently won an Olivier award for her role as Sally Bowles in the critically acclaimed West End revival of &#x27;Cabaret&#x27; - was discovered by Lord Webber as an 18-year-old when she auditioned for his BBC talent show &#x27;I&#x27;d Do Anything&#x27; back in 2008, which sought to find an actress to play Nancy in his West End revival of Oliver! Despite being a favourite to win the series, Jessie eventually came runner up to Jodie Prenger on the show and the composer went on to claim that losing out on the role was the &quot;best possible&quot; outcome for the Oscar-nominated star. He said: &quot;I got to know her pretty well after the TV show. I think, in a way, her not winning it was the best possible thing that could have happened.&quot;',\\n       ...\\n       'A special sales tax to fund supplemental police patrols in the French Quarter will be reinstated starting in October after expiring at the end of 2020. The tax was approved by voters in an April ballot measure and was supposed to take effect last month, but it was delayed due to a legal dispute over whether hotel room sales could be exempt, as they had been previously.\\xa0 But on Thursday, the New Orleans City Council, acting as the French Quarter Economic Development District, the state-created body responsible for levying the tax, voted to reinstate the tax with the hotel exemption intact.\\xa0 It’s still not clear whether the legal issues surrounding the hotel room cut-out are resolved. The exemption, which was not included in the April ballot language that went before French Quarter voters, appears to fly in the face of a decision made by the State Bond Commission in consultation with the State Attorney General’s Office earlier this year, as well as a legal opinion sent to The Lens in July by Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s office.\\xa0 The chair of the Economic Development District, Councilwoman Kristin Palmer, has yet to fully explain how Thursday’s resolution is consistent with the State Bond Commission guidance. On Thursday, she said she was unaware of the objections from the Cantrell administration. Maintaining the hotel exemption was a major priority for the French Quarter Management District, a state-created board made up of representatives of the hospitality industry, French Quarter residents and city government. The FQMD has been extremely influential in the renewal process for the tax, and was given explicit administrative authority over the funds it will generate through the April ballot measure. In July, as council members were preparing to reinstate the tax, the FQMD asked Palmer to delay the tax by three months due to uncertainty over the legality of the hotel exemption. The request to delay was criticized by one FQMD board member, who said that it was bad for public safety and called the FQMD a “business dominated board.” The result of Thursday’s vote is that businesses will be required to collect the tax beginning in October. But before any of the money is actually spent, the city needs to finalize a cooperative endeavor agreement between Mayor Cantrell, the FQEDD and the FQMD.\\xa0 The hotel exemption Thursday’s meeting didn’t include any public discussion about why hotel room sales were being exempted from the tax. In an interview after the meeting, Palmer defended the exemption, saying that hotel room sales are already subject to a number of special taxes that don’t apply to other businesses.\\xa0 “The hotel rooms pay additional taxes over and beyond what the regular sales tax is,” Palmer said. “So this would be considered like a triple tax.” She also emphasized that the exemption was only for hotel room rentals, and that other sales at hotels, like at hotel bars or restaurants, would still be subject to the tax.\\xa0 But Palmer didn’t have a complete rebuttal to the legal concerns raised by the city and State Bond Commission. Her only explanation was that the exemption was a matter of precedent.\\xa0 “The precedent is established because it’s been that way for the past five years,” she said. “That was always the agreement and always the arrangement.” The French Quarter public safety tax, sometimes referred to as the “quarter for the quarter,” was first approved by French Quarter residents in 2015 and went into effect in 2016. From 2016 until 2020, the funds were exclusively used to pay for additional patrols in the neighborhood by the Louisiana State Police.\\xa0 Hotel room sales were exempt from that tax. The exemption wasn’t explicitly included in the 2015 ballot measure, but was later implemented through a FQEDD resolution at a 2016 meeting. As The Lens previously reported, the legal justification for that decision wasn’t mentioned during that meeting, nor any other FQEDD meeting in 2015 or 2016. The only explanation The Lens was able to find was a footnote in a 2015 BGR report on the ballot initiative.\\xa0 “In correspondence with BGR, the city pointed out that economic development districts, by statute, may levy ‘up to two percent of sales taxes, or up to two percent of hotel occupancy taxes.’ (La. R.S. 33:9038.39.) It indicated that, because the language implies a choice between two options, the sales tax should not apply to hotel occupancy.” As the former tax was about to expire at the end of last year, the FQEDD and Cantrell unsuccessfully attempted to renew the tax through a December 2020 ballot measure.\\xa0 Under a plan from the Cantrell administration, the money would have been split between paying for local police patrols and civilian “grounds patrol” units that could help with quality of life issues. The FQMD campaigned against it, and the ballot measure failed with 595 opposed to 297 in favor.\\xa0 The FQMD wanted a larger oversight role and more money dedicated to police patrols through a program it has managed since 2016 — the French Quarter Task Force. After the December ballot measure was shot down, the FQMD began working directly with the FQEDD to introduce a new ballot measure that would give the FQMD explicit administrative powers over the funds. The original April ballot language crafted by the FQMD and FQEDD also included an explicit exemption for hotel room sales. But before the language was finalized, it needed approval from the State Bond Commission. And in February, commission analyst James Pounders told the city the commission wouldn’t approve the ballot language unless the hotel rental exemption was removed based on legal advice from the Attorney General’s Office. “It does not appear the proposition is able to move forward in its current state,” Pounders said.\\xa0 “Essentially, in order to be exempt from local sales taxes, it must either be (1) an item that is exempt from state sales taxes; or (2) a specific tax exemption granted by the legislature that is applicable to all political subdivisions/taxing authorities.” He said that his office looked at state statute regarding local sales tax exemptions, and that it didn’t appear that hotel rooms had any statutory exemption from sales taxes. “Regardless, we think the FQ EDD must provide the statute that they are relying on when granting the hotel tax exemption,” he said. Lela Folse, director of the State Bond Commission, told The Lens on Thursday that the commission hadn’t revisited the issue since February, and therefore its stance hadn’t changed.The FQEDD ultimately removed the exemption from the April ballot, but the FQMD was still determined to establish the exemption through other means.Cantrell’s office, however, has taken the same position as the Bond Commission. City officials sent The Lens a July opinion from its legal counsel that also said hotel room rentals cannot be exempt from the tax.\\xa0 “The tax cannot provide an exemption for hotels. That being said, if no one litigates the issue, it may go forward unnoticed. In this instance, the State Bond Commission brought the issue to light, and the FQEDD amended the voter proposition to take out the exemption for hotels. The public is on notice that the hotel exemption was an issue, and it would be highly risky for the FQEDD to attempt to exempt hotels.” The opinion explicitly warned that the FQEDD could not pass a resolution to create the exemption, which is exactly what the FQEDD ended up doing on Thursday.\\xa0 CEA Negotiations The Cantrell administration, meanwhile, is in the process of negotiating a cooperative endeavor agreement governing the administration of the tax proceeds, which must be signed by the mayor, the FQEDD and the FQMD before the proceeds of the tax can actually be spent.\\xa0 Though the language in the ballot initiative called for giving control to the FQMD, the administration has consistently opposed handing over the funds to the unelected board.\\xa0 “The core issue here is really around good governance,” Josh Cox, a senior adviser to Cantrell, said during a January FQEDD meeting. “And the principle is simple: When taxpayer money is collected, the people who are administering that money should be directly elected by taxpayers.” (There are several examples of existing property and sales taxes administered by unelected boards. In fact, the Cantrell administration, as part of its 2019 “fair share” infrastructure funding deal with the tourism industry and the state, helped negotiate a new short-term rental tax law that hands over a portion of collections to New Orleans & Company, the city’s tourism marketing agency, which is not only unelected but privately run.) The most recent draft of the French Quarter sales tax CEA, provided by the city, effectively gives the mayor and City Council final authority over how the money is spent.\\xa0 The city can’t spend the money on whatever it wants. It will still need to be primarily used for supplemental police patrols as set out in the ballot language approved by voters. But the city and City Council will have authority over the exact details of the annual budget. The annual budget for the funds, according to the current CEA draft, will be written by the city’s chief administrative officer and approved by the City Council. The FQMD will have the opportunity to recommend changes to the budget before the FQEDD finalizes it, but it doesn’t appear they have any type of veto authority if the FQEDD chooses not to accept those recommendations.\\xa0 The CEA hasn’t been signed yet. On Thursday, along with the vote to levy the tax, the FQEDD voted to give Palmer the authority to negotiate and sign the CEA on its behalf. And on Monday, the FQMD is holding a special meeting to consider approving the agreement.\\xa0 The original agenda for the FQMD’s Monday meeting included a discussion about the issue of French Quarter businesses that have continued to collect the quarter-cent sales tax throughout 2021 even though it expired at the end of 2020. (That item was removed from the agenda on Thursday and will no longer be part of Monday’s meeting.) French Quarter Business Association Executive Director Brittany Mulla McGovern told The Lens this week that the city failed to inform businesses to stop collecting the tax. “To the best of our knowledge, the City of New Orleans never notified businesses within the FQEDD boundaries to cease collection,” McGovern said in an email. “We hope that the City will manage the sales tax more efficiently in the future.”\\xa0 In response, Cantrell spokesman Beau Tidwell told The Lens that “we did in fact alert businesses that the tax expired, in a press release dated June 30th.” The tax had expired six months before that press release was issued.\\xa0 Tidwell did not answer questions about whether there is a standard procedure for notifying businesses about expiring sales taxes and whether that procedure was followed in this case. He also didn’t respond to a question about how much money the city has collected from the expired tax so far this year.

The original April ballot language crafted by the FQMD and FQEDD also included an explicit exemption for hotel room sales. But before the language was finalized, it needed approval from the State Bond Commission. And in February, commission analyst James Pounders told the city the commission wouldn’t approve the ballot language unless the hotel rental exemption was removed based on legal advice from the Attorney General’s Office. “It does not appear the proposition is able to move forward in its current state,” Pounders said.\\xa0 “Essentially, in order to be exempt from local sales taxes, it must either be (1) an item that is exempt from state sales taxes; or (2) a specific tax exemption granted by the legislature that is applicable to all political subdivisions/taxing authorities.” He said that his office looked at state statute regarding local sales tax exemptions, and that it didn’t appear that hotel rooms had any statutory exemption from sales taxes. “Regardless, we think the FQ EDD must provide the statute that they are relying on when granting the hotel tax exemption,” he said. Lela Folse, director of the State Bond Commission, told The Lens on Thursday that the commission hadn’t revisited the issue since February, and therefore its stance hadn’t changed.The FQEDD ultimately removed the exemption from the April ballot, but the FQMD was still determined to establish the exemption through other means.Cantrell’s office, however, has taken the same position as the Bond Commission. City officials sent The Lens a July opinion from its legal counsel that also said hotel room rentals cannot be exempt from the tax.\\xa0 “The tax cannot provide an exemption for hotels. That being said, if no one litigates the issue, it may go forward unnoticed. In this instance, the State Bond Commission brought the issue to light, and the FQEDD amended the voter proposition to take out the exemption for hotels. The public is on notice that the hotel exemption was an issue, and it would be highly risky for the FQEDD to attempt to exempt hotels.” The opinion explicitly warned that the FQEDD could not pass a resolution to create the exemption, which is exactly what the FQEDD ended up doing on Thursday.\\xa0 CEA Negotiations The Cantrell administration, meanwhile, is in the process of negotiating a cooperative endeavor agreement governing the administration of the tax proceeds, which must be signed by the mayor, the FQEDD and the FQMD before the proceeds of the tax can actually be spent.\\xa0 Though the language in the ballot initiative called for giving control to the FQMD, the administration has consistently opposed handing over the funds to the unelected board.\\xa0 “The core issue here is really around good governance,” Josh Cox, a senior adviser to Cantrell, said during a January FQEDD meeting. “And the principle is simple: When taxpayer money is collected, the people who are administering that money should be directly elected by taxpayers.” (There are several examples of existing property and sales taxes administered by unelected boards. In fact, the Cantrell administration, as part of its 2019 “fair share” infrastructure funding deal with the tourism industry and the state, helped negotiate a new short-term rental tax law that hands over a portion of collections to New Orleans & Company, the city’s tourism marketing agency, which is not only unelected but privately run.) The most recent draft of the French Quarter sales tax CEA, provided by the city, effectively gives the mayor and City Council final authority over how the money is spent.\\xa0 The city can’t spend the money on whatever it wants. It will still need to be primarily used for supplemental police patrols as set out in the ballot language approved by voters. But the city and City Council will have authority over the exact details of the annual budget. The annual budget for the funds, according to the current CEA draft, will be written by the city’s chief administrative officer and approved by the City Council. The FQMD will have the opportunity to recommend changes to the budget before the FQEDD finalizes it, but it doesn’t appear they have any type of veto authority if the FQEDD chooses not to accept those recommendations.\\xa0 The CEA hasn’t been signed yet. On Thursday, along with the vote to levy the tax, the FQEDD voted to give Palmer the authority to negotiate and sign the CEA on its behalf. And on Monday, the FQMD is holding a special meeting to consider approving the agreement.\\xa0 The original agenda for the FQMD’s Monday meeting included a discussion about the issue of French Quarter businesses that have continued to collect the quarter-cent sales tax throughout 2021 even though it expired at the end of 2020. (That item was removed from the agenda on Thursday and will no longer be part of Monday’s meeting.) French Quarter Business Association Executive Director Brittany Mulla McGovern told The Lens this week that the city failed to inform businesses to stop collecting the tax. “To the best of our knowledge, the City of New Orleans never notified businesses within the FQEDD boundaries to cease collection,” McGovern said in an email. “We hope that the City will manage the sales tax more efficiently in the future.”\\xa0 In response, Cantrell spokesman Beau Tidwell told The Lens that “we did in fact alert businesses that the tax expired, in a press release dated June 30th.” The tax had expired six months before that press release was issued.\\xa0 Tidwell did not answer questions about whether there is a standard procedure for notifying businesses about expiring sales taxes and whether that procedure was followed in this case. He also didn’t respond to a question about how much money the city has collected from the expired tax so far this year. This story has been updated to reflect that the French Quarter Management District has removed a discussion about erroneously collected taxes from its upcoming meeting agenda.',\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    'The New Orleans City Council’s two-day, mid-year city budget hearings got off to a rocky start on Monday when Councilman Jared Brossett accused Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration of refusing to participate. “Although they were given adequate notice, the administration has continued to refuse to participate in these hearings in good faith,” Brossett said. “This is not acceptable.” The agenda for Monday’s meeting originally included 13 departmental presentations and was scheduled to last nine hours. Instead, the council heard just two presentations in under two hours — one relatively lengthy one from Chief Administrative Officer Gilbert Montaño and a brief one from the Civil Service Department.\\xa0 Councilman Brossett had requested that each city department and agency present a “comprehensive update of their 2021 budget,” as well as their planned expenditures using federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act and a list of coronavirus-related expenses incurred so far this year.\\xa0\\xa0 Montaño admitted that he didn’t have all that information ready on Monday, but said that his presentation was an attempt to fill the council in on the most important questions surrounding\\xa0 the city’s budget. “The administration’s presentation will not provide what you or your team has requested at this time,” he said. “The administration certainly does not agree with your characterization or sentiment. In fact we think that participating in good faith is ultimately what we’re doing.” Although he didn’t bring all the information Brossett asked for, Montaño did outline key information related to a central request from Brossett — an explanation of how the city plans to use $388 million in federal aid provided through the federal American Rescue Plan Act, the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package passed in March. Montaño laid out the administration’s plans to use those funds to boost this year’s budget by $70 million — the first allocation of the federal dollars. The money would go to fill gaps in the 2021 budget, which was about $100 million lower than what the city had expected prior to pandemic-related revenue shortfalls.\\xa0 According to Montaño’s presentation, the $70 million would be used on a number of initiatives, including increased overtime pay for public safety agencies, license plate readers, restorative justice programs, early childhood education, short-term rental enforcement, illegal dumping alleviation and to “rebuild” the City Planning Commission staff. The allocation would need City Council approval and Montaño said he expects to bring the issue back to the council with more comprehensive information in September.\\xa0 The kind of comprehensive mid-year budget hearings Brossett requested are not typical. The City Council often receives mid-year budget updates on certain public safety agencies. But the kind of citywide, department-by-department presentations Brossett was seeking usually occur in the fall as the city sets its annual budget for the upcoming year.\\xa0 But this is not a typical year, Brossett argued, and it calls for increased scrutiny as the city deals with deep financial losses on the one hand, and hundreds of millions in federal aid on the other.\\xa0 “We will all have to make difficult decisions both now and in the future based on the fiscal realities of the city,” Brossett said. Montaño’s resistance to the mid-year budget presentations wasn’t a surprise. He told Brossett as much in a July 19 letter that was previously reported by The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate.\\xa0 On Monday, Montaño repeated his objections to the hearings, including that fulfilling Brossett’s entire request would get in the way of the administration’s preparations for passing the 2022 budget.\\xa0 “The 2022 budget will be one of the most consequential budgets for the future of New Orleans,” he said. “Unfortunately the timing of the request for these hearings could jeopardize the natural budget cycle designed to accommodate this process. That is not something we’re willing to risk based on an artificial timeline created.” American Rescue Plan spending One of the points of contention between Brossett and the Cantrell administration is over a lack of a clear plan for how the city will spend the funds from the American Rescue Plan. The city has actually received $194 million so far, of the $388 million total it expects. “The CAO and [chief financial officer] have provided little to no information regarding their proposed plans for American Rescue Plan funds,” Brossett said on Monday “We find this problematic.” Brossett told Montaño he wanted to see a list of exactly how the money would be spent. But Montaño said that likely wouldn’t happen. “There will never be a list that matches $194 million with $194 million of expenditures,” Montaño said.\\xa0 As he’s explained in the past, the city’s approach is to spread the Rescue Plan funds through 2025 to account for sustained, lingering financial impacts from the pandemic. The city has estimated that recurring revenue will only get back to pre-pandemic levels in 2025.\\xa0 The Cantrell administration measures the city’s fiscal health in terms of recurring revenue — revenue sources like property taxes that the city can rely on to come in every year, as opposed to one-time funds like federal stimulus money that likely won’t be available in future years.\\xa0 Montaño said that lingering uncertainties, including the highly infectious delta variant of the coronavirus — which has led to a new statewide mask mandate — make it nearly impossible to estimate exactly what needs the city will have to fill over the next four years. He did, however, present on how the administration plans to use the money to bolster the 2021 budget.“We don’t see the ARP funding as an additional windfall for the city,” Montaño said. “Instead we view these funds as a way to close the gaps in the city’s continued projected revenue loss through 2025 when we expect the city to fully recover. There is debate on that 2025 recovery period, and there’s now a variable with the delta variant, but we’re maintaining conservative estimates and keeping it at 2025.” The administration plans to ask the City Council in September to approve an ordinance to allocate the first $70 million. Montaño broke down the uses of the money into four categories —\\xa0”crime and public safety,” “new initiatives focused on public safety,” “restore government operations” and “improve quality of life.”\\xa0 The “crime and public safety” category largely revolves around increasing personnel at the New Orleans Police Department, fire department and EMS. That includes $11 million for increased overtime at those three agencies and $300,000 for NOPD patrol officer promotions. Another $8 million would go to the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office to pay for mental health services for inmates. The city would also use $1 million to buy an additional 150 to 160 new license plate readers for crime reduction, particularly in eastern New Orleans. The request will also include increased funding for the SPCA.\\xa0 The “new initiatives focused on public safety” category includes less traditional public safety initiatives. That includes creating a non-law enforcement behavioral health crisis response unit to answer some 911 calls. The initiative would include in-patient care, a crisis stabilization facility and ongoing outpatient care. “This is, we feel, the future of many police departments as far as strategies,” Montaño said. “You see this happening throughout the country.” Money would also be invested in a partnership between the District Attorney’s Office and the Center for Restorative Approaches to create a restorative justice program. The three-year pilot program would seek to divert 560 cases from criminal proceedings. The city also plans to spend money on the Municipal Court Mental Health Unit — a program operated by the Orleans Public Defenders that seeks to get mental health services to people who regularly cycle in and out of the court system due to mental illness. The third category of the $70 million dedication is restoring governmental operations.\\xa0 Montaño said this money would be used to reimburse city employees for furloughs that were put in place in late 2020 as a cost saving measure and ended in early 2021. The city would also buy new vehicles for public safety agencies and the Department of Public Works.\\xa0 Also in that third category is new personnel funding. The administration wants to hire five new short-term rental enforcement employees in the Department of Safety and Permits, as well as a dedicated short-term rental attorney. Code Enforcement would get another four employees for the lot abatement program. Montaño said the money would also go to “rebuild” the City Planning Commission staff, although he said a staffing plan is still in the works.\\xa0 Funding for the quality-of-life category includes $4 million for the administration’s anti-blight and litter initiative, CleanUp NOLA, as well as $1.5 million to fund another 112 seats in early childhood education programs. The money would also be used to pay down the long list of court judgements against the city.\\xa0',\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    'The New Orleans City Council’s two-day, mid-year city budget hearings got off to a rocky start on Monday when Councilman Jared Brossett accused Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration of refusing to participate. “Although they were given adequate notice, the administration has continued to refuse to participate in these hearings in good faith,” Brossett said. “This is not acceptable.” The agenda for Monday’s meeting originally included 13 departmental presentations and was scheduled to last nine hours.

He told Brossett as much in a July 19 letter that was previously reported by The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate.\\xa0 On Monday, Montaño repeated his objections to the hearings, including that fulfilling Brossett’s entire request would get in the way of the administration’s preparations for passing the 2022 budget.\\xa0 “The 2022 budget will be one of the most consequential budgets for the future of New Orleans,” he said. “Unfortunately the timing of the request for these hearings could jeopardize the natural budget cycle designed to accommodate this process. That is not something we’re willing to risk based on an artificial timeline created.” American Rescue Plan spending One of the points of contention between Brossett and the Cantrell administration is over a lack of a clear plan for how the city will spend the funds from the American Rescue Plan. The city has actually received $194 million so far, of the $388 million total it expects. “The CAO and [chief financial officer] have provided little to no information regarding their proposed plans for American Rescue Plan funds,” Brossett said on Monday “We find this problematic.” Brossett told Montaño he wanted to see a list of exactly how the money would be spent. But Montaño said that likely wouldn’t happen. “There will never be a list that matches $194 million with $194 million of expenditures,” Montaño said.\\xa0 As he’s explained in the past, the city’s approach is to spread the Rescue Plan funds through 2025 to account for sustained, lingering financial impacts from the pandemic. The city has estimated that recurring revenue will only get back to pre-pandemic levels in 2025.\\xa0 The Cantrell administration measures the city’s fiscal health in terms of recurring revenue — revenue sources like property taxes that the city can rely on to come in every year, as opposed to one-time funds like federal stimulus money that likely won’t be available in future years.\\xa0 Montaño said that lingering uncertainties, including the highly infectious delta variant of the coronavirus — which has led to a new statewide mask mandate — make it nearly impossible to estimate exactly what needs the city will have to fill over the next four years. He did, however, present on how the administration plans to use the money to bolster the 2021 budget.“We don’t see the ARP funding as an additional windfall for the city,” Montaño said. “Instead we view these funds as a way to close the gaps in the city’s continued projected revenue loss through 2025 when we expect the city to fully recover. There is debate on that 2025 recovery period, and there’s now a variable with the delta variant, but we’re maintaining conservative estimates and keeping it at 2025.” The administration plans to ask the City Council in September to approve an ordinance to allocate the first $70 million. Montaño broke down the uses of the money into four categories —\\xa0”crime and public safety,” “new initiatives focused on public safety,” “restore government operations” and “improve quality of life.”\\xa0 The “crime and public safety” category largely revolves around increasing personnel at the New Orleans Police Department, fire department and EMS. That includes $11 million for increased overtime at those three agencies and $300,000 for NOPD patrol officer promotions. Another $8 million would go to the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office to pay for mental health services for inmates. The city would also use $1 million to buy an additional 150 to 160 new license plate readers for crime reduction, particularly in eastern New Orleans. The request will also include increased funding for the SPCA.\\xa0 The “new initiatives focused on public safety” category includes less traditional public safety initiatives. That includes creating a non-law enforcement behavioral health crisis response unit to answer some 911 calls. The initiative would include in-patient care, a crisis stabilization facility and ongoing outpatient care. “This is, we feel, the future of many police departments as far as strategies,” Montaño said. “You see this happening throughout the country.” Money would also be invested in a partnership between the District Attorney’s Office and the Center for Restorative Approaches to create a restorative justice program. The three-year pilot program would seek to divert 560 cases from criminal proceedings. The city also plans to spend money on the Municipal Court Mental Health Unit — a program operated by the Orleans Public Defenders that seeks to get mental health services to people who regularly cycle in and out of the court system due to mental illness. The third category of the $70 million dedication is restoring governmental operations.\\xa0 Montaño said this money would be used to reimburse city employees for furloughs that were put in place in late 2020 as a cost saving measure and ended in early 2021. The city would also buy new vehicles for public safety agencies and the Department of Public Works.\\xa0 Also in that third category is new personnel funding. The administration wants to hire five new short-term rental enforcement employees in the Department of Safety and Permits, as well as a dedicated short-term rental attorney. Code Enforcement would get another four employees for the lot abatement program. Montaño said the money would also go to “rebuild” the City Planning Commission staff, although he said a staffing plan is still in the works.\\xa0 Funding for the quality-of-life category includes $4 million for the administration’s anti-blight and litter initiative, CleanUp NOLA, as well as $1.5 million to fund another 112 seats in early childhood education programs. The money would also be used to pay down the long list of court judgements against the city.\\xa0',\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    'The New Orleans City Council’s two-day, mid-year city budget hearings got off to a rocky start on Monday when Councilman Jared Brossett accused Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration of refusing to participate. “Although they were given adequate notice, the administration has continued to refuse to participate in these hearings in good faith,” Brossett said. “This is not acceptable.” The agenda for Monday’s meeting originally included 13 departmental presentations and was scheduled to last nine hours. Instead, the council heard just two presentations in under two hours — one relatively lengthy one from Chief Administrative Officer Gilbert Montaño and a brief one from the Civil Service Department.\\xa0 Councilman Brossett had requested that each city department and agency present a “comprehensive update of their 2021 budget,” as well as their planned expenditures using federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act and a list of coronavirus-related expenses incurred so far this year.\\xa0\\xa0 Montaño admitted that he didn’t have all that information ready on Monday, but said that his presentation was an attempt to fill the council in on the most important questions surrounding\\xa0 the city’s budget. “The administration’s presentation will not provide what you or your team has requested at this time,” he said. “The administration certainly does not agree with your characterization or sentiment. In fact we think that participating in good faith is ultimately what we’re doing.” Although he didn’t bring all the information Brossett asked for, Montaño did outline key information related to a central request from Brossett — an explanation of how the city plans to use $388 million in federal aid provided through the federal American Rescue Plan Act, the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package passed in March. Montaño laid out the administration’s plans to use those funds to boost this year’s budget by $70 million — the first allocation of the federal dollars. The money would go to fill gaps in the 2021 budget, which was about $100 million lower than what the city had expected prior to pandemic-related revenue shortfalls.\\xa0 According to Montaño’s presentation, the $70 million would be used on a number of initiatives, including increased overtime pay for public safety agencies, license plate readers, restorative justice programs, early childhood education, short-term rental enforcement, illegal dumping alleviation and to “rebuild” the City Planning Commission staff.

He told Brossett as much in a July 19 letter that was previously reported by The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate.\\xa0 On Monday, Montaño repeated his objections to the hearings, including that fulfilling Brossett’s entire request would get in the way of the administration’s preparations for passing the 2022 budget.\\xa0 “The 2022 budget will be one of the most consequential budgets for the future of New Orleans,” he said. “Unfortunately the timing of the request for these hearings could jeopardize the natural budget cycle designed to accommodate this process. That is not something we’re willing to risk based on an artificial timeline created.” American Rescue Plan spending One of the points of contention between Brossett and the Cantrell administration is over a lack of a clear plan for how the city will spend the funds from the American Rescue Plan. The city has actually received $194 million so far, of the $388 million total it expects. “The CAO and [chief financial officer] have provided little to no information regarding their proposed plans for American Rescue Plan funds,” Brossett said on Monday “We find this problematic.” Brossett told Montaño he wanted to see a list of exactly how the money would be spent. But Montaño said that likely wouldn’t happen. “There will never be a list that matches $194 million with $194 million of expenditures,” Montaño said.\\xa0 As he’s explained in the past, the city’s approach is to spread the Rescue Plan funds through 2025 to account for sustained, lingering financial impacts from the pandemic. The city has estimated that recurring revenue will only get back to pre-pandemic levels in 2025.\\xa0 The Cantrell administration measures the city’s fiscal health in terms of recurring revenue — revenue sources like property taxes that the city can rely on to come in every year, as opposed to one-time funds like federal stimulus money that likely won’t be available in future years.\\xa0 Montaño said that lingering uncertainties, including the highly infectious delta variant of the coronavirus — which has led to a new statewide mask mandate — make it nearly impossible to estimate exactly what needs the city will have to fill over the next four years. He did, however, present on how the administration plans to use the money to bolster the 2021 budget.“We don’t see the ARP funding as an additional windfall for the city,” Montaño said. “Instead we view these funds as a way to close the gaps in the city’s continued projected revenue loss through 2025 when we expect the city to fully recover. There is debate on that 2025 recovery period, and there’s now a variable with the delta variant, but we’re maintaining conservative estimates and keeping it at 2025.” The administration plans to ask the City Council in September to approve an ordinance to allocate the first $70 million. Montaño broke down the uses of the money into four categories —\\xa0”crime and public safety,” “new initiatives focused on public safety,” “restore government operations” and “improve quality of life.”\\xa0 The “crime and public safety” category largely revolves around increasing personnel at the New Orleans Police Department, fire department and EMS. That includes $11 million for increased overtime at those three agencies and $300,000 for NOPD patrol officer promotions. Another $8 million would go to the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office to pay for mental health services for inmates. The city would also use $1 million to buy an additional 150 to 160 new license plate readers for crime reduction, particularly in eastern New Orleans. The request will also include increased funding for the SPCA.\\xa0 The “new initiatives focused on public safety” category includes less traditional public safety initiatives. That includes creating a non-law enforcement behavioral health crisis response unit to answer some 911 calls. The initiative would include in-patient care, a crisis stabilization facility and ongoing outpatient care. “This is, we feel, the future of many police departments as far as strategies,” Montaño said. “You see this happening throughout the country.” Money would also be invested in a partnership between the District Attorney’s Office and the Center for Restorative Approaches to create a restorative justice program. The three-year pilot program would seek to divert 560 cases from criminal proceedings. The city also plans to spend money on the Municipal Court Mental Health Unit — a program operated by the Orleans Public Defenders that seeks to get mental health services to people who regularly cycle in and out of the court system due to mental illness. The third category of the $70 million dedication is restoring governmental operations.\\xa0 Montaño said this money would be used to reimburse city employees for furloughs that were put in place in late 2020 as a cost saving measure and ended in early 2021. The city would also buy new vehicles for public safety agencies and the Department of Public Works.\\xa0 Also in that third category is new personnel funding. The administration wants to hire five new short-term rental enforcement employees in the Department of Safety and Permits, as well as a dedicated short-term rental attorney. Code Enforcement would get another four employees for the lot abatement program. Montaño said the money would also go to “rebuild” the City Planning Commission staff, although he said a staffing plan is still in the works.\\xa0 Funding for the quality-of-life category includes $4 million for the administration’s anti-blight and litter initiative, CleanUp NOLA, as well as $1.5 million to fund another 112 seats in early childhood education programs. The money would also be used to pay down the long list of court judgements against the city.\\xa0',\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    'The New Orleans City Council’s two-day, mid-year city budget hearings got off to a rocky start on Monday when Councilman Jared Brossett accused Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration of refusing to participate. “Although they were given adequate notice, the administration has continued to refuse to participate in these hearings in good faith,” Brossett said. “This is not acceptable.” The agenda for Monday’s meeting originally included 13 departmental presentations and was scheduled to last nine hours. Instead, the council heard just two presentations in under two hours — one relatively lengthy one from Chief Administrative Officer Gilbert Montaño and a brief one from the Civil Service Department.\\xa0 Councilman Brossett had requested that each city department and agency present a “comprehensive update of their 2021 budget,” as well as their planned expenditures using federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act and a list of coronavirus-related expenses incurred so far this year.\\xa0\\xa0 Montaño admitted that he didn’t have all that information ready on Monday, but said that his presentation was an attempt to fill the council in on the most important questions surrounding\\xa0 the city’s budget. “The administration’s presentation will not provide what you or your team has requested at this time,” he said. “The administration certainly does not agree with your characterization or sentiment. In fact we think that participating in good faith is ultimately what we’re doing.” Although he didn’t bring all the information Brossett asked for, Montaño did outline key information related to a central request from Brossett — an explanation of how the city plans to use $388 million in federal aid provided through the federal American Rescue Plan Act, the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package passed in March. Montaño laid out the administration’s plans to use those funds to boost this year’s budget by $70 million — the first allocation of the federal dollars. The money would go to fill gaps in the 2021 budget, which was about $100 million lower than what the city had expected prior to pandemic-related revenue shortfalls.\\xa0 According to Montaño’s presentation, the $70 million would be used on a number of initiatives, including increased overtime pay for public safety agencies, license plate readers, restorative justice programs, early childhood education, short-term rental enforcement, illegal dumping alleviation and to “rebuild” the City Planning Commission staff. The allocation would need City Council approval and Montaño said he expects to bring the issue back to the council with more comprehensive information in September.\\xa0 The kind of comprehensive mid-year budget hearings Brossett requested are not typical. The City Council often receives mid-year budget updates on certain public safety agencies. But the kind of citywide, department-by-department presentations Brossett was seeking usually occur in the fall as the city sets its annual budget for the upcoming year.\\xa0 But this is not a typical year, Brossett argued, and it calls for increased scrutiny as the city deals with deep financial losses on the one hand, and hundreds of millions in federal aid on the other.\\xa0 “We will all have to make difficult decisions both now and in the future based on the fiscal realities of the city,” Brossett said.

They were met with a socially distanced — but filled to capacity — room of Alfred Lawless High School alumni.\\xa0 Boardroom seating for the public was limited to 23 spaced chairs. Many other people watched the meeting from an overflow area. Board members’ traditional podium style seating was separated into two stadium style rows with plexiglass barriers, as the city endures a fourth and rather alarming spike in COVID-19 cases.\\xa0 The Lawless alumni were there to advocate for the board to restore the school’s name to its Law Street* property — which was renamed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Charter School when the Friends of King charter group moved into the facility in 2015. (Shortly after that, the board banned the naming of buildings for charter schools.) “Lawless is just not a building, it’s a fiber, it’s who we are,” said class of 1984 graduate Randolph Davis. Rev. Brenda Square also supported the change, noting that Lawless, who served as principal of Fisk Colored School, was a strong advocate for the education for the city’s Black students in the early 20th Century.\\xa0 “Replacing Alfred Lawless with Martin Luther King would suggest we have no local leaders with stories worth recognition,” Square said. “His ministry was the foundation on which Martin Luther King himself was propelled forward. This history of Black education is rooted in the Lawless legacy.” The proposal for the school building to return to its historic name comes as the board is separately working on removing longtime school names from dozens of other campuses. In those other cases, the schools were named after people who were Confederate sympathizers, owned slaves or supported school segregation.\\xa0 All speakers but one were supportive of the Lawless proposal, which would only rename the facility — not the charter school using it. That was Joseph Recasner, a King charter school employee, who suggested a compromise.\\xa0 “We are in total agreement that the name of Alfred Lawless should be on King high school,” he said. “It should be on there as the Dr. Martin Luther King Charter School at Alfred Lawless.” The board committee approved the name change, along with new names for five additional buildings.Bethune Elementary will be renamed for Enrique Alferez and the Stuart Bradley campus will be renamed Mary Mcleod Bethune, where the charter named for Bethune now resides. Lake Area High School will be renamed after John F. Kennedy, the school recently renamed itself after Kennedy and has been working with its alumni group. Village de l’Est will be renamed for Dominic Mai Thanh Luong and Arthur Ashe will be renamed for Vorice Jackson-Waters. COVID-19 operations Chief Operations Officer Tiffany Delcour told board members on Tuesday that the NOLA Public Schools district will continue COVID-19 vaccine drives and testing as it prepares for the new school year.\\xa0 They are also watching the city’s case data closely, she said, noting the district had already re-imposed a mask requirement for all students, after first planning to only require masks for unvaccinated students and employees. The announcement came after New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell instituted an indoor mask “advisory” last week, strongly recommending masks in public places regardless of vaccination status. The CDC made similar recommendations this week.\\xa0 “As we know with COVID-19, the only thing we know is a given is change,” Delcour said. “We’ve added a new section to our guidance, ‘temporary operational procedures.’ ” Delcour said the district is also working to develop a small financial incentive to encourage eligible students to get the vaccine. Details on that program weren’t immediately clear. The district is partnering with the Louisiana Department of Health to bring weekly testing to any interested school for the upcoming school year. “We will be participating in one of their largest weekly routine testing projects,” Delcour said. Board members Katie Baudouin and Olin Parker offered a few suggestions. “At some point we might need to start thinking about requiring vaccines, or requiring testing,” Baudouin said. “I’m glad we’re starting with incentives.” Parker suggested the district make student testing the default — asking families to “opt-out” rather than an “opt-in” — to increase participation.\\xa0 Myrialis King, CEO of charter school operator Community Academies of New Orleans, attended the meeting and told members about a Monday vaccine drive.\\xa0 “The first four people I saw were people who said they would not get the vaccine in May.” Board member J.C. Romero asked about virtual school as an option for students. District Chief of Staff Mary Garton* said it would be offered on a limited basis.\\xa0 “We want kids in school,” she said. “Students and families have always had the option in acute or specific medical situations for virtual instruction,” she said. “We are not offering virtual instruction on a broad scale.” Attendance rates suffered during virtual schooling last school year. Finance and policy Also at Tuesday’s meeting, district Chief Financial Officer Stuart Gay presented monthly financials and introduced the 2021-2022 school year budget. The budget varies quite a bit from previous years in certain areas, in part because the district is no longer directly operating any schools. Its one remaining “direct-run” school, Mary D. Coghill School, transferred to the Hynes Charter School group. Gay explained several line items look different due to classification errors discovered during the district’s annual financial audit, which is about seven months past its initial deadline. “Ink is drying on the audit as we speak, and it will be submitted by the end of this week,” Gay said, noting the district had received another extension. “We have seven audit findings.” Auditors outlined those findings earlier this year. The committee also voted to increase the auditors’ contract to $250,000 due to extra work required to complete this year’s audit, Gay said. It is expected to be $125,000 next year. Schools will still feel the pandemic in their budgets this year, Gay said, with per-pupil funding forecast to drop from $9,423 per student to $9,069. He also estimates schools will see $500 negative deferred revenue per pupil as they did last school year.\\xa0 “This is a tough year,” Gay said. “We’re looking forward to 2022.” “The sales tax rebound is really what we’re looking for, we’re hoping everyone gets vaccinated and everyone stays safe because it has an absolute effect on the resources available to students,” he said. Legislative consultant Rodney Braxton briefly reviewed laws passed during the last legislative session. He highlighted the legalization of sports betting, noting it will eventually bring some revenue to state per-pupil funding and early childhood education. Additionally, a bill from Sen. Joe Bouie written to restore the School Board’s ability to vote on charter schools passed. This bill removed language from state law that required a “two-thirds vote of full membership” to override the superintendent’s recommendation.\\xa0 “It basically returns the authority so that you can follow your own policy,” Braxton said. The board’s policy, however, still requires a two-thirds vote. This could come into play Thursday when the superintendent is expected to recommend the revocation of the Dryades YMCA’s charter contract for James M. Singleton Charter School. The YMCA and district are participating in court-ordered mediation. Board member Carlos Zervigon thanked Bouie for working with the board on crafting the bill. Board President Ethan Ashley also updated board members on the superintendent search. Last month, Lewis announced he would not seek a contract renewal when his contract expires at the end June in 2022. The board will hold a work session Thursday to discuss what they’d like to see in a search firm and then develop an RFP to find such a contractor.

This history of Black education is rooted in the Lawless legacy.” The proposal for the school building to return to its historic name comes as the board is separately working on removing longtime school names from dozens of other campuses. In those other cases, the schools were named after people who were Confederate sympathizers, owned slaves or supported school segregation.\\xa0 All speakers but one were supportive of the Lawless proposal, which would only rename the facility — not the charter school using it. That was Joseph Recasner, a King charter school employee, who suggested a compromise.\\xa0 “We are in total agreement that the name of Alfred Lawless should be on King high school,” he said. “It should be on there as the Dr. Martin Luther King Charter School at Alfred Lawless.” The board committee approved the name change, along with new names for five additional buildings.Bethune Elementary will be renamed for Enrique Alferez and the Stuart Bradley campus will be renamed Mary Mcleod Bethune, where the charter named for Bethune now resides. Lake Area High School will be renamed after John F. Kennedy, the school recently renamed itself after Kennedy and has been working with its alumni group. Village de l’Est will be renamed for Dominic Mai Thanh Luong and Arthur Ashe will be renamed for Vorice Jackson-Waters. COVID-19 operations Chief Operations Officer Tiffany Delcour told board members on Tuesday that the NOLA Public Schools district will continue COVID-19 vaccine drives and testing as it prepares for the new school year.\\xa0 They are also watching the city’s case data closely, she said, noting the district had already re-imposed a mask requirement for all students, after first planning to only require masks for unvaccinated students and employees. The announcement came after New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell instituted an indoor mask “advisory” last week, strongly recommending masks in public places regardless of vaccination status. The CDC made similar recommendations this week.\\xa0 “As we know with COVID-19, the only thing we know is a given is change,” Delcour said. “We’ve added a new section to our guidance, ‘temporary operational procedures.’ ” Delcour said the district is also working to develop a small financial incentive to encourage eligible students to get the vaccine. Details on that program weren’t immediately clear. The district is partnering with the Louisiana Department of Health to bring weekly testing to any interested school for the upcoming school year. “We will be participating in one of their largest weekly routine testing projects,” Delcour said. Board members Katie Baudouin and Olin Parker offered a few suggestions. “At some point we might need to start thinking about requiring vaccines, or requiring testing,” Baudouin said. “I’m glad we’re starting with incentives.” Parker suggested the district make student testing the default — asking families to “opt-out” rather than an “opt-in” — to increase participation.\\xa0 Myrialis King, CEO of charter school operator Community Academies of New Orleans, attended the meeting and told members about a Monday vaccine drive.\\xa0 “The first four people I saw were people who said they would not get the vaccine in May.” Board member J.C. Romero asked about virtual school as an option for students. District Chief of Staff Mary Garton* said it would be offered on a limited basis.\\xa0 “We want kids in school,” she said. “Students and families have always had the option in acute or specific medical situations for virtual instruction,” she said. “We are not offering virtual instruction on a broad scale.” Attendance rates suffered during virtual schooling last school year. Finance and policy Also at Tuesday’s meeting, district Chief Financial Officer Stuart Gay presented monthly financials and introduced the 2021-2022 school year budget. The budget varies quite a bit from previous years in certain areas, in part because the district is no longer directly operating any schools. Its one remaining “direct-run” school, Mary D. Coghill School, transferred to the Hynes Charter School group. Gay explained several line items look different due to classification errors discovered during the district’s annual financial audit, which is about seven months past its initial deadline. “Ink is drying on the audit as we speak, and it will be submitted by the end of this week,” Gay said, noting the district had received another extension. “We have seven audit findings.” Auditors outlined those findings earlier this year. The committee also voted to increase the auditors’ contract to $250,000 due to extra work required to complete this year’s audit, Gay said. It is expected to be $125,000 next year. Schools will still feel the pandemic in their budgets this year, Gay said, with per-pupil funding forecast to drop from $9,423 per student to $9,069. He also estimates schools will see $500 negative deferred revenue per pupil as they did last school year.\\xa0 “This is a tough year,” Gay said. “We’re looking forward to 2022.” “The sales tax rebound is really what we’re looking for, we’re hoping everyone gets vaccinated and everyone stays safe because it has an absolute effect on the resources available to students,” he said. Legislative consultant Rodney Braxton briefly reviewed laws passed during the last legislative session. He highlighted the legalization of sports betting, noting it will eventually bring some revenue to state per-pupil funding and early childhood education. Additionally, a bill from Sen. Joe Bouie written to restore the School Board’s ability to vote on charter schools passed. This bill removed language from state law that required a “two-thirds vote of full membership” to override the superintendent’s recommendation.\\xa0 “It basically returns the authority so that you can follow your own policy,” Braxton said. The board’s policy, however, still requires a two-thirds vote. This could come into play Thursday when the superintendent is expected to recommend the revocation of the Dryades YMCA’s charter contract for James M. Singleton Charter School. The YMCA and district are participating in court-ordered mediation. Board member Carlos Zervigon thanked Bouie for working with the board on crafting the bill. Board President Ethan Ashley also updated board members on the superintendent search. Last month, Lewis announced he would not seek a contract renewal when his contract expires at the end June in 2022. The board will hold a work session Thursday to discuss what they’d like to see in a search firm and then develop an RFP to find such a contractor.

       "array(['SHREVEPORT, La. -- Every week or so, an assistant U.S. Attorney in Shreveport meets with an agent from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosive to go over illegal gun possession arrests made by local law enforcement agencies. They are looking for cases to take. It’s part of an effort across the country to respond to growing pressures to reduce the rise in gun violence. Federal prosecutors are taking more lower-level, run-of-the-mill gun cases that used to be the bailiwick of local prosecutors. Much of the time, defendants will face a higher probability of longer prison terms. Prosecutors are identifying cases with aggravating factors such as defendants with gang affiliations, a history of violence and involvement in drug trafficking. KTBS News reviewed indictments returned against eight men this summer and fall in Shreveport. Two of the defendants were suspects in murders; authorities allege all are members of gangs; and half have extensive criminal records. Another factor, prosecutors said, is individuals with reputations that make citizens reluctant to talk to police. One of the defendants had been released on bond after an arrest for attempted murder killed a man in a gang retaliation three months later, authorities said. Federal prosecutors in the Western District of Louisiana, which includes all of north Louisiana as well as the Lafayette and Lake Charles areas, have nearly doubled the number of firearms prosecutions in the past five years – from 63 in 2017 to 115 this year. “I’m disturbed at the firepower we’re seeing; I’m not surprised,” acting U.S. Attorney Alexander Van Hook of Shreveport said. “There’s a lot of violence out there and a lot of it is gang related. Those are the type of weapons we’re going after.” The sources of the guns are from two primary places: stolen from automobiles and houses, and “straw purchases” where guns are bought for people who can’t legally purchase them, such as convicted felons. Van Hook said Operation Safe Neighborhoods began in 2017 with the goal of reducing violent crime by focusing on gang and drug prosecutions. Violent crime went down for a while before reversing itself, and Van Hook conceded there are parts of Shreveport that are not safe today. He attributed much of the violence in the last year to civil unrest over police brutality and heightened tensions in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. “Until the crime rates are much lower and the citizens in every part of our city feel safe, our job isn’t done,” Van Hook said. “I think there are parts of Shreveport that are safe. Our job is to make sure that everyone in every community feels safe. You can’t succeed in life and address the other problems you have unless you feel safe.” KTBS News also reviewed four federal cases where the defendants were sentenced this summer and fall for being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm: Punishments ranged from three and a third- to seven years. Local prosecutors don’t always accept federal authorities’ request to take a case. A man found asleep in a car at a Shreveport intersection had an assault weapon and smorgasbord of drugs in his car. Federal authorities requested the case but Caddo prosecutors kept it, saying they wanted him to serve more time than federal law allows. Their plea offer is 20 years in prison or face prosecution next month as an habitual offender. “Our case load is 20 times more than the feds,” Caddo District Attorney James Stewart said. “The routine gun cases will do all right in federal court. But they don’t handle ‘blood and guts’ cases, and if you have someone you really want to put away and it’s a crime of violence, the penalty in state court is greater.” KTBS News reviewed six Shreveport cases the U.S. Attorney’s Office opened this summer and fall, looking at not only the federal charges but also past criminal cases that put the defendants on the feds’ radar: Brown was arrested last year in connection with the shooting and wounding of a man as the victim and his girlfriend waited at a stoplight in Shreveport. An 18-month-old child was in the back seat. Brown postedbond a month after his arrest, and less than three months later killed a man who was ambushed when he stepped out of his apartment, a Caddo Parish grand jury charged. Prosecutors said in court filings that the slaying was in retaliation for an earlier shooting. During a candlelight memorial for the murder victim, a group drove by and started shooting, police said. No one at the memorial was hit but bullets went into two apartments, including one where a woman was in bed with her child. They were not hurt. Brown has been charged with property damage in that case. Caddo prosecutors said in a court filing that Brown is a member of a gang that “are responsible for much of the gun violence in Shreveport.” Pierce was a suspect in a homicide that occurred on June 1, 2016, when three gang members pulled up to a house in the MLK neighborhood, got out of a pickup that had been stolen in a carjacking and started arguing with a group there, Shreveport police said. Each side began shooting, leaving one man dead and two others wounded. Pierce denied involvement. Police said neighbors were afraid to talk and Caddo prosecutors concluded there was not enough evidence to file murder charges. He was prosecuted for illegal use of a weapon and sentenced to 18 months in prison. Pierce has arrests going back more than a decade, Caddo District Court records show. He got a two-year sentence for burglary in 2013 and a suspended sentence in 2011 for firing a gun into the air. When federal prosecutors took his case this year, he was facing drug possession and illegal possession of weapons charges in Caddo court. He’d pleaded not guilty. Court records show Ruffins has been arrested 10 times on drugs, weapons, battery and unauthorized entry into a dwelling in the last 11 years. He has four convictions, four cases have been dismissed and three are pending. His longest sentence by far was four years for a shooting in 2012, court records show. Shreveport police said Ruffins had a .45-caliber pistol when he ran into a house last March trying to hide from narcotics agents. Federal prosecutors are using that incident to try to send him to prison for being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. Federal prosecutors have charged Smith with being a convicted felon in possession of a loaded .40-caliber handgun. He was arrested last month by a violent crime abatement team whose members had been tailing him. He was arrested after being pulled over for a minor traffic violation. They were arrested last month after a chase that began when a deputy tried to pull them over for a traffic violation. Authorities said the men eventually ditched the car and ran. Deputies said they found two long guns in the car. Brooks at the time was wanted for shooting and wounding a man in Shreveport’s Mooretown neighborhood. Solomon was wanted as an accessory to attempted murder, police said. The traffic stop occurred hours after a nearby shooting that occurred after a dozen people had gathered outside a gas station. Shell casings found at the scene were the same caliber and make of the ammunition found with Dominique but he has not been charged in that slaying, Bienville authorities said. Dominique is under indictment on charges of possession of marijuana and possession of a firearm during a drug-trafficking crime. He has pleaded not guilty.'],\n",

       "       'An unidentified Abbeville teen was taken to a local hospital after sustaining a gunshot wound Tuesday afternoon, area officials confirmed Wednesday. A second teen was taken into custody in connection with the shooting. The incident occurred around 2:50 p.m. near the intersection of Schlessinger Street and Maude Avenue in southeastern Abbeville, Lt. Jonathan Touchet, Abbeville police spokesman, said. Thomas J. Byler, Vermilion superintendent of schools, said although the shooting took place off campus, he responded by tightening security at the victim&#x27;s school and providing counselors at the school where the victim attended. Byler and Touchet said the shooting occurred perhaps 10 minutes after the victim got off a school bus that transported high school and junior high school students home. Byler said the bus driver was contacted some 30 minutes after the shooting and had not witnessed any violent attacks, nor had the students on the bus. The driver was surprised to learn there had been a shooting. Byler said the victim and the shooter, who was apprehended Wednesday morning, may have quarreled previously. However, he said Facebook Live depicted a second school bus in the area that had slowed down near the area of the shooting. He said some viewers mistakenly thought the second bus was the same bus that had dropped off the victim in the area. Touchet said while investigating Tuesday’s shooting, a detective recognized a suspect from an unrelated October shooting in which a victim was seriously hurt. He said officers arrested Jha’Juan Campbell, 19, of Abbeville in connection with the Oct. 11 shooting, which occurred in north Abbeville. Campbell was charged with two counts of attempted first-degree murder and transported to the Vermilion Parish Sheriff’s Office.',\n",
       "       'ULM police arrested two men last Sunday for possession of a firearm on campus after one suspect shot a student in the Madison Hall dorm. The suspects are Dallas Strawder, 18, of 16 Jana Dr., Monroe, and Jamonte Davis, 18, of 533 Lakeside Dr., Monroe. Davis is a freshman business administration major who lives in the dorm room where the shooting occurred. Strawder is not a student. According to the arrest report, officers were dispatched to a Madison Hall dorm room in reference to the discharge of a firearm. The victim told officers she and Strawder were in the room when she asked him to put the handgun away. She said Strawder then took the magazine out of the gun and pulled the slide back, which was when the gun accidentally fired and hit her lower right leg. Officers made contact with Strawder at 3811 Desiard St. and placed him under arrest. Strawder told officers the gun belonged to the second arrestee, Davis, according to the arrest report. Davis was also arrested at 3811 Desiard St. Before questioning, Davis admitted to possessing a handgun in his dorm room while another handgun negligently fired. Davis also said he took the handgun to a different address before police questioning, according to the arrest report. Both suspects were booked at Ouachita Correctional Center on the above charge. Strawder was also charged with negligent injuring.',\n",
